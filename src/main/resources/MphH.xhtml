					<td class="ab">Background: One of the goals of cancer treatment is symptoms management especially at the end stage. The common symptoms in cancer include pain, fatigue, depression and cognitive dysfunction. The available treatment options for symptom management are limited. Methylphenidate, a psychostimulant, may be of benefit for these patients. In this report, we review the use of methylphenidate for symptoms control in cancer patients. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Electronic literature search on PubMed was conducted using the following keywords: methylphenidate, cancer, carcinoma, oncology, oncological and tumour. We identified forty two relevant studies and publications on the use of methylphenidate in cancer patients to be included in this review. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Methylphenidate was found to have some evidence in reducing opioid-induced sedation, improving cognitive symptoms and reduction of fatigue in cancer patients. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent due to variations in the study populations, study design and outcome measures, among others. There was minimal evidence on its use in treating depression. Otherwise, methylphenidate was generally well-tolerated by patients. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): This review potentially supports the use of methylphenidate for opioid-induced sedation, cognitive decline and fatigue in cancer patients. Further placebo-controlled trials would help in strengthening the evidence for this treatment.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.</td>

					<td class="ab">Background: Methylphenidate or Ritalin is an amphetamine derivative and a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is chemically similar to cocaine. A lot of reports have been made on Ritalin abuse. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the relative frequency of Ritalin consumption and its associated factors among medical students in different steps at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Using stratified random sampling, this descriptive analytical study was conducted on medical students in different steps at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in 2015. The checklist included the subjects&#039; background information, and also the questions associated with the frequency of Ritalin consumption and its underlying causes. Independent sample t-test was used to analyze the quantitative variables with normal distribution, and Chi-square test or Fisher&#039;s exact test to analyze the qualitative variables. However, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney were applied as non- parametric tests to analyze the quantitative variables with non-normal distributions. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): This study was conducted on 340 medical students in different steps, and the response rate was reported as 91%. The frequency of Ritalin consumption among students was 17.3%. The excessive consumption of Ritalin by medical students was observed within the exams period (83%); smoking cigarette was reported in 75.5% of Ritalin user students and drug addiction in 20.8%. There was a significant difference in Ritalin consumption between the students living on- campus or off- campus and those living with their spouse or parents [OR (95% CI) = 0.5 (0.27-0.93)]; however, the higher consumption of Ritalin was reported in the first group. Moreover, a significant difference was revealed in Ritalin consumption between non-smoking students and smoking ones [OR (95% CI) = 40.34 (18.34-88.72)]. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Regarding the prevalence of Ritalin consumption along with smoking cigarette and addiction to drugs among the students living on-campus, immediate preventive interventions are required for the people in the same age group who are living together in social environment as well as students at risk of more damages due to the abuse of such medications.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, Razavi International Journal of Medicine.

Moreover, a significant difference was revealed in Ritalin consumption between non-smoking students and smoking ones [OR (95% CI) = 40.34 (18.34-88.72)]. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Regarding the prevalence of Ritalin consumption along with smoking cigarette and addiction to drugs among the students living on-campus, immediate preventive interventions are required for the people in the same age group who are living together in social environment as well as students at risk of more damages due to the abuse of such medications.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, Razavi International Journal of Medicine.

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Methylphenidate or Ritalin is an amphetamine derivative and a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is chemically similar to cocaine. A lot of reports have been made on Ritalin abuse. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the relative frequency of Ritalin consumption and its associated factors among medical students in different steps at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Using stratified random sampling, this descriptive analytical study was conducted on medical students in different steps at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in 2015. The checklist included the subjects&#039; background information, and also the questions associated with the frequency of Ritalin consumption and its underlying causes. Independent sample t-test was used to analyze the quantitative variables with normal distribution, and Chi-square test or Fisher&#039;s exact test to analyze the qualitative variables. However, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney were applied as non- parametric tests to analyze the quantitative variables with non-normal distributions. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): This study was conducted on 340 medical students in different steps, and the response rate was reported as 91%. The frequency of Ritalin consumption among students was 17.3%. The excessive consumption of Ritalin by medical students was observed within the exams period (83%); smoking cigarette was reported in 75.5% of Ritalin user students and drug addiction in 20.8%. There was a significant difference in Ritalin consumption between the students living on- campus or off- campus and those living with their spouse or parents [OR (95% CI) = 0.5 (0.27-0.93)]; however, the higher consumption of Ritalin was reported in the first group. Moreover, a significant difference was revealed in Ritalin consumption between non-smoking students and smoking ones [OR (95% CI) = 40.34 (18.34-88.72)]. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Regarding the prevalence of Ritalin consumption along with smoking cigarette and addiction to drugs among the students living on-campus, immediate preventive interventions are required for the people in the same age group who are living together in social environment as well as students at risk of more damages due to the abuse of such medications.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, Razavi International Journal of Medicine.

					<td class="ab">Purpose of Review: We review non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches to managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We examine methods for assessment and evidence for interventions, focusing on recent findings and innovations. Finally, we recommend an algorithm for management of BPSD. Recent Findings: Training of formal caregivers is the most effective intervention for BPSD; other non-pharmacological interventions are also beneficial. Antidepressants and antipsychotics remain a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for BPSD. There is limited evidence supporting the use of stimulants, cognitive enhancers, dextromethorphan/quinidine, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and pimavanserin. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Summary: The management of BPSD is highly individualized. Following thorough assessment, the initial step is addressing contributing medical problems. Non-pharmacological interventions should be tried prior to pharmacological interventions. Antipsychotics should be prescribed only when behaviors pose a significant safety risk or if the person with dementia is very distressed. New approaches will be needed to address an increasing population of people with dementia.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Purpose of Review: We review non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches to managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We examine methods for assessment and evidence for interventions, focusing on recent findings and innovations. Finally, we recommend an algorithm for management of BPSD. Recent Findings: Training of formal caregivers is the most effective intervention for BPSD; other non-pharmacological interventions are also beneficial. Antidepressants and antipsychotics remain a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for BPSD. There is limited evidence supporting the use of stimulants, cognitive enhancers, dextromethorphan/quinidine, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and pimavanserin. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Summary: The management of BPSD is highly individualized. Following thorough assessment, the initial step is addressing contributing medical problems. Non-pharmacological interventions should be tried prior to pharmacological interventions. Antipsychotics should be prescribed only when behaviors pose a significant safety risk or if the person with dementia is very distressed. New approaches will be needed to address an increasing population of people with dementia.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</span><span>Management of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Objective: Methylphenidate activates mu-opioid receptors, which are linked to euphoria. mu-Opioid antagonists, such as naltrexone, may attenuate the euphoric effects of stimulants, thereby minimizing their abuse potential. This study assessed whether the combination of naltrexone with methylphenidate is well-tolerated while preserving the clinical benefits of stimulants in subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We conducted a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of naltrexone in adults with DSM-IV ADHD receiving open treatment with a long-acting formulation of methylphenidate from January 2013 to July 2015. Spheroidal Oral Drug Absorption System (SODAS) methylphenidate was administered twice daily, was titrated to approximately 1 mg/kg/d over 3 weeks, and was continued for 3 additional weeks depending on response and adverse effects. Subjects were adults with ADHD preselected for having experienced euphoria with a test dose of immediate-release methylphenidate. The primary outcome measure was the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Thirty-seven subjects who experienced stimulant-induced (mild) euphoria at a baseline visit were started in the open trial of SODAS methylphenidate and randomly assigned to naltrexone 50 mg or placebo. Thirty-one subjects completed the study through week 3, and 25 completed through week 6. Throughout 6 weeks of blinded naltrexone and open methylphenidate treatment, the coadministration of naltrexone with methylphenidate did not interfere with the clinical effectiveness of methylphenidate for ADHD symptoms. Additionally, the combination of naltrexone and methylphenidate did not produce an increase in adverse events compared with methylphenidate alone. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our findings provide support for the concept of combining opioid receptor antagonists with stimulants to provide an effective stimulant formulation with less abuse potential.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2017 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objective: Methylphenidate activates mu-opioid receptors, which are linked to euphoria. mu-Opioid antagonists, such as naltrexone, may attenuate the euphoric effects of stimulants, thereby minimizing their abuse potential. This study assessed whether the combination of naltrexone with methylphenidate is well-tolerated while preserving the clinical benefits of stimulants in subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We conducted a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of naltrexone in adults with DSM-IV ADHD receiving open treatment with a long-acting formulation of methylphenidate from January 2013 to July 2015. Spheroidal Oral Drug Absorption System (SODAS) methylphenidate was administered twice daily, was titrated to approximately 1 mg/kg/d over 3 weeks, and was continued for 3 additional weeks depending on response and adverse effects. Subjects were adults with ADHD preselected for having experienced euphoria with a test dose of immediate-release methylphenidate. The primary outcome measure was the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Thirty-seven subjects who experienced stimulant-induced (mild) euphoria at a baseline visit were started in the open trial of SODAS methylphenidate and randomly assigned to naltrexone 50 mg or placebo. Thirty-one subjects completed the study through week 3, and 25 completed through week 6. Throughout 6 weeks of blinded naltrexone and open methylphenidate treatment, the coadministration of naltrexone with methylphenidate did not interfere with the clinical effectiveness of methylphenidate for ADHD symptoms. Additionally, the combination of naltrexone and methylphenidate did not produce an increase in adverse events compared with methylphenidate alone. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our findings provide support for the concept of combining opioid receptor antagonists with stimulants to provide an effective stimulant formulation with less abuse potential.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2017 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</span><span>Opiate antagonists do not interfere with the clinical benefits of stimulants in ADHD: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the mixed opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background: Although risk factors for medication-overuse headache have been identified within the general population, most studies have neglected clinical samples. The present study examined the relative and combined associations of these factors with medication-overuse headache in a sample of US adults seeking treatment for primary headache disorders. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Treatment-seeking headache patients provided data on demographics, headache variables, psychiatric variables, use of headache medications, and use of other prescription medications and substances. A classification tree selection strategy was utilized within this cross-sectional study to differentiate between those with and without medication-overuse headache, and a final multivariable model assessed their combined utility. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Forty-three of 164 participants (26.2%) met diagnostic criteria for medication-overuse headache. Relative to non-medication-overuse headache participants, participants with medication-overuse headache reported greater headache-related disability (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.18), escape and avoidance responses indicative of fear of pain (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.15), and use of combination medications for headache (odds ratio = 3.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.51-6.36). The final multivariable model differentiated well between the 2 groups (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve =.78; 95% confidence interval =.71-.86). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Items that assess headache-related disability, use of combination medications, and fear of pain help identify patients who are currently overusing acute headache medications and may serve as indicators of treatment progress. Future studies should apply similar analytic approaches longitudinally to identify headache sufferers at risk for medication-overuse headache prior to headache progression.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 American Headache Society</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Although risk factors for medication-overuse headache have been identified within the general population, most studies have neglected clinical samples. The present study examined the relative and combined associations of these factors with medication-overuse headache in a sample of US adults seeking treatment for primary headache disorders. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Treatment-seeking headache patients provided data on demographics, headache variables, psychiatric variables, use of headache medications, and use of other prescription medications and substances. A classification tree selection strategy was utilized within this cross-sectional study to differentiate between those with and without medication-overuse headache, and a final multivariable model assessed their combined utility. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Forty-three of 164 participants (26.2%) met diagnostic criteria for medication-overuse headache. Relative to non-medication-overuse headache participants, participants with medication-overuse headache reported greater headache-related disability (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.18), escape and avoidance responses indicative of fear of pain (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.15), and use of combination medications for headache (odds ratio = 3.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.51-6.36). The final multivariable model differentiated well between the 2 groups (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve =.78; 95% confidence interval =.71-.86). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Items that assess headache-related disability, use of combination medications, and fear of pain help identify patients who are currently overusing acute headache medications and may serve as indicators of treatment progress. Future studies should apply similar analytic approaches longitudinally to identify headache sufferers at risk for medication-overuse headache prior to headache progression.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 American Headache Society</span><span>Factors Associated With Medication-Overuse Headache in Patients Seeking Treatment for Primary Headache</span><span>adderall</span><span>ambien</span><span>botox</span><span>dexedrine</span><span>halcion</span><span>klonopin</span><span>oxycontin</span><span>percocet</span><span>restoril</span><span>ritalin</span><span>valium</span><span>vicodin</span><span>xanax</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Methylphenidate is effective in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults, but its long term use can cause potential adverse effect on growth rate and variable effects on appetite. Previous studies have shown that long term administration of psychostimulant drugs increases the effectiveness of somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-&lt;ovid:inf&gt;1A&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; receptors. Repeated administration of buspirone attenuates the effectiveness of somatodendritic 5-HT&lt;ovid:inf&gt;1A&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; receptors. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that coadministration of buspirone may attenuate methylphenidate-induced effects on growth rate and food intake. Growth rate was calculated weekly in terms of change in body weight as percentage of preceding week&#039;s body weight and food intake was calculated weekly by subtracting the amount of food left in the hopper from the amount of food placed in the hopper as % in preceding week mg/gm of body weight after long-term administration of methylphenidate, buspirone and their co-administration. Long term oral administration of methylphenidate at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/day decrease growth rate, but co-administration of buspirone at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day attenuates effect of methylphenidate on growth rate however food intake was significantly greater in all treated groups after 3 weeks of treatment. It is suggested that buspirone may oppose methylphenidate-induced growth inhibition by decreasing the sensitivity of somatodendritic 5- HT&lt;ovid:inf&gt;1A&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; receptors. These findings may help to extend future therapeutics in ADHD.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) are more likely than the general population to develop risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this clinical population. To address this disproportionate medical burden, we developed Nutrition Exercise and Wellness Treatment (NEW Tx), a lifestyle intervention for individuals with BD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): In this study, participants were randomized to NEW Tx (n = 19) or a treatment as usual waitlist (n = 19). We examine the intervention&#039;s efficacy to improve the physical and psychological outcomes of individuals with BD. Assessors were blind to participant condition throughout study duration. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): The NEW Tx group reported increased weekly exercise duration and overall functioning, and decreased depression and illness severity over the study duration. However, only improvements in functioning were significantly greater in the NEW Tx group than in the control group. There were no group differences in weight loss or mood symptoms over the study duration. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Limitation(s): Limitations to this study include lack of objective measurement of exercise and a small and relatively homogeneous sample. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): These data suggest that a manualized lifestyle intervention for BD may not be ideal to improve lifestyle changes in this clinical population. Further research is needed to pilot personalized approaches to creating a healthy lifestyle in BD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019</span><span>Pilot study of a lifestyle intervention for bipolar disorder: Nutrition exercise wellness treatment (NEW Tx)</span><span>abilify</span><span>ambien</span><span>ativan</span><span>concerta</span><span>depakote</span><span>desyrel</span><span>effexor</span><span>geodon</span><span>klonopin</span><span>lamictal</span><span>lexapro</span><span>neurontin</span><span>prozac</span><span>risperdal</span><span>seroquel</span><span>tegretol</span><span>vyvanse</span><span>wellbutrin</span><span>zoloft</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Anhedonia is defined as a diminished ability to experience interest or pleasure, and is a critical psychopathological dimension of major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of the current systematic review is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological treatments on measures of anhedonia in adults with MDD. Electronic databases Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 1, 2018 for longitudinal studies utilizing pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anhedonia in patients with MDD. A total of 17 eligible studies were identified (i.e., evaluated the effects of pharmacotherapy on a measure of anhedonia). Among the identified studies, the efficacy of 14 different pharmacotherapies on measures of anhedonia were evaluated, including melatonergic agents (i.e. agomelatine), monoaminergic agents (i.e. moclobemide, clomipramine, bupropion, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, amitifadine and levomilnacipran, escitalopram, and sertraline), glutamatergic agents (i.e., ketamine and riluzole), stimulants (i.e., methylphenidate), and psychedelics (i.e., psilocybin). Based on the available evidence, most antidepressants demonstrated beneficial effects on measures of anhedonia as well as the other depressive symptoms. Only escitalopram/riluzole combination treatment was ineffective in treating symptoms of anhedonia in MDD. Continued research is warranted to further support the efficacy of mechanistically-distinct antidepressants in treating symptoms of anhedonia in MDD. Future research should also aim to parse out the heterogeneous effects of different pharmacotherapies on anhedonic symptoms.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Inc.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Anhedonia is defined as a diminished ability to experience interest or pleasure, and is a critical psychopathological dimension of major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of the current systematic review is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological treatments on measures of anhedonia in adults with MDD. Electronic databases Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 1, 2018 for longitudinal studies utilizing pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anhedonia in patients with MDD. A total of 17 eligible studies were identified (i.e., evaluated the effects of pharmacotherapy on a measure of anhedonia). Among the identified studies, the efficacy of 14 different pharmacotherapies on measures of anhedonia were evaluated, including melatonergic agents (i.e. agomelatine), monoaminergic agents (i.e. moclobemide, clomipramine, bupropion, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, amitifadine and levomilnacipran, escitalopram, and sertraline), glutamatergic agents (i.e., ketamine and riluzole), stimulants (i.e., methylphenidate), and psychedelics (i.e., psilocybin). Based on the available evidence, most antidepressants demonstrated beneficial effects on measures of anhedonia as well as the other depressive symptoms. Only escitalopram/riluzole combination treatment was ineffective in treating symptoms of anhedonia in MDD. Continued research is warranted to further support the efficacy of mechanistically-distinct antidepressants in treating symptoms of anhedonia in MDD. Future research should also aim to parse out the heterogeneous effects of different pharmacotherapies on anhedonic symptoms.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Inc.</span><span>Pharmacological interventions targeting anhedonia in patients with major depressive disorder: A systematic review</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Traumatic brain injury can reduce striatal dopamine levels. The cause of this is uncertain, but is likely to be related to damage to the nigrostriatal system. We investigated the pattern of striatal dopamine abnormalities using 123 I-Ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans and their relationship to nigrostriatal damage and clinical features. We studied 42 moderate-severe traumatic brain injury patients with cognitive impairments but no motor parkinsonism signs and 20 healthy controls. 123 I-Ioflupane scanning was used to assess dopamine transporter levels. Clinical scan reports were compared to quantitative dopamine transporter results. Advanced MRI methods were used to assess the nigrostriatal system, including the area through which the nigrostriatal projections pass as defined from high-resolution Human Connectome data. Detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments were performed. Around 20% of our moderate-severe patients had clear evidence of reduced specific binding ratios for the dopamine transporter in the striatum measured using 123 I-Ioflupane SPECT. The caudate was affected more consistently than other striatal regions. Dopamine transporter abnormalities were associated with reduced substantia nigra volume. In addition, diffusion MRI provided evidence of damage to the regions through which the nigrostriatal tract passes, particularly the area traversed by dopaminergic projections to the caudate. Only a small percentage of patients had evidence of macroscopic lesions in the striatum and there was no relationship between presence of lesions and dopamine transporter specific binding ratio abnormalities. There was also no relationship between reduced volume in the striatal subregions and reduced dopamine transporter specific binding ratios. Patients with low caudate dopamine transporter specific binding ratios show impaired processing speed and executive dysfunction compared to patients with normal levels. Taken together, our results suggest that the dopaminergic system is affected by a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury in a significant proportion of patients, even in the absence of clinical motor parkinsonism. Reduced dopamine transporter levels are most commonly seen in the caudate and this is likely to reflect the pattern of nigrostriatal tract damage produced by axonal injury and associated midbrain damage.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) (2018).

					<td class="tw"><span>Traumatic brain injury can reduce striatal dopamine levels. The cause of this is uncertain, but is likely to be related to damage to the nigrostriatal system. We investigated the pattern of striatal dopamine abnormalities using 123 I-Ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans and their relationship to nigrostriatal damage and clinical features. We studied 42 moderate-severe traumatic brain injury patients with cognitive impairments but no motor parkinsonism signs and 20 healthy controls. 123 I-Ioflupane scanning was used to assess dopamine transporter levels. Clinical scan reports were compared to quantitative dopamine transporter results. Advanced MRI methods were used to assess the nigrostriatal system, including the area through which the nigrostriatal projections pass as defined from high-resolution Human Connectome data. Detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments were performed. Around 20% of our moderate-severe patients had clear evidence of reduced specific binding ratios for the dopamine transporter in the striatum measured using 123 I-Ioflupane SPECT. The caudate was affected more consistently than other striatal regions. Dopamine transporter abnormalities were associated with reduced substantia nigra volume. In addition, diffusion MRI provided evidence of damage to the regions through which the nigrostriatal tract passes, particularly the area traversed by dopaminergic projections to the caudate. Only a small percentage of patients had evidence of macroscopic lesions in the striatum and there was no relationship between presence of lesions and dopamine transporter specific binding ratio abnormalities. There was also no relationship between reduced volume in the striatal subregions and reduced dopamine transporter specific binding ratios. Patients with low caudate dopamine transporter specific binding ratios show impaired processing speed and executive dysfunction compared to patients with normal levels. Taken together, our results suggest that the dopaminergic system is affected by a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury in a significant proportion of patients, even in the absence of clinical motor parkinsonism. Reduced dopamine transporter levels are most commonly seen in the caudate and this is likely to reflect the pattern of nigrostriatal tract damage produced by axonal injury and associated midbrain damage.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) (2018).

					<td class="tw"><span>Use of transdermal patches can evade many issues associated with oral drug delivery, such as first-pass hepatic metabolism, enzymatic digestion attack, drug hydrolysis and degradation in acidic media, drug fluctuations, and gastrointestinal irritation. This article reviews various transdermal patches available in the market, types, structural components, polymer role, and the required assessment tools. Although transdermal patches have medical applications for smoking cessation, pain relief, osteoporosis, contraception, motion sickness, angina pectoris, and cardiac disorders, advances in formulation development are ongoing to make transdermal patches capable of delivering more challenging drugs. Transdermal patches can be tailored and developed according to the physicochemical properties of active and inactive components, and applicability for long-term use. Therefore, a number of chemical approaches and physical techniques for transdermal patch development are under investigation.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Othman A.

					<td class="ab">Purpose of Review: To present current data on the coexistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults and children and to discuss possible mechanisms. Recent Findings: Emerging data suggest that risk factors for obesity and insulin resistance such as diabetes during pregnancy and intrauterine growth failure may also have a role in the development of ADHD. Furthermore, ADHD and obesity share lifestyle factors, such as abnormal eating patterns, binge eating, and a sedentary lifestyle. ADHD is a risk factor for components of the metabolic syndrome, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and also hypertension, both in adults and youth. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Summary: Associations of ADHD with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension have been ascertained, and various mechanisms have been proposed. Research is needed to decipher the shared genetic, pharmacological, and lifestyle risk factors. Individuals with ADHD should be treated as a high-risk group for cardiometabolic complications.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</td>

					<td class="ab">Background Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be comorbid with frequent anxiety and mood disorders, as well as emotional symptoms (anxiety, irritability, mood lability). These may also be triggered by drugs and appear as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Methods We mined data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System pharmacovigilance database, focused on methylphenidate, atomoxetine, amphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and their derivatives. We collected reports of ADRs connected with mood or emotional symptoms in pediatric patients, excluding drug abuse/accidents. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) were calculated and compared between drug classes and children/adolescents. Results We collected 6176 ADRs of interest of which 59% occurred in children. Atomoxetine accounted for 50.7% of reports, methylphenidate for 32.5%, lisdexamfetamine for 14.2%, and amphetamine for 2.6%. Irritability, anxiety, obsessive thoughts, depressed mood, and euphoria scored significant RORs for all drugs, overall with an increasing risk from methylphenidate to atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, and amphetamine. Apathy regarded mostly atomoxetine, and crying regarded all drugs except methylphenidate. Several age-based differences were found. Notably, affect lability hit only adolescents. All drugs scored significant self-injury RORs, except lisdexamfetamine in adolescents, with an increasing risk from methylphenidate to lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine, and amphetamine. For suicidality, all drugs had significant RORs in children, and methylphenidate was better than atomoxetine and lisdexamfetamine. In adolescents, only methylphenidate and atomoxetine scored significant RORs. Conclusions We conclude that real-world data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System are consistent with previous evidence from meta-analyses. They support a hierarchy of drug safety for several ADRs (except self-injury/suicidality) with methylphenidate as safest, followed by atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, and amphetamine last. Self-injury and suicidality RORs were overall higher in children.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

					<td class="tw"><span>Background Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be comorbid with frequent anxiety and mood disorders, as well as emotional symptoms (anxiety, irritability, mood lability). These may also be triggered by drugs and appear as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Methods We mined data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System pharmacovigilance database, focused on methylphenidate, atomoxetine, amphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and their derivatives. We collected reports of ADRs connected with mood or emotional symptoms in pediatric patients, excluding drug abuse/accidents. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) were calculated and compared between drug classes and children/adolescents. Results We collected 6176 ADRs of interest of which 59% occurred in children. Atomoxetine accounted for 50.7% of reports, methylphenidate for 32.5%, lisdexamfetamine for 14.2%, and amphetamine for 2.6%. Irritability, anxiety, obsessive thoughts, depressed mood, and euphoria scored significant RORs for all drugs, overall with an increasing risk from methylphenidate to atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, and amphetamine. Apathy regarded mostly atomoxetine, and crying regarded all drugs except methylphenidate. Several age-based differences were found. Notably, affect lability hit only adolescents. All drugs scored significant self-injury RORs, except lisdexamfetamine in adolescents, with an increasing risk from methylphenidate to lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine, and amphetamine. For suicidality, all drugs had significant RORs in children, and methylphenidate was better than atomoxetine and lisdexamfetamine. In adolescents, only methylphenidate and atomoxetine scored significant RORs. Conclusions We conclude that real-world data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System are consistent with previous evidence from meta-analyses. They support a hierarchy of drug safety for several ADRs (except self-injury/suicidality) with methylphenidate as safest, followed by atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, and amphetamine last. Self-injury and suicidality RORs were overall higher in children.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Behavioural disorders have also been reported. Two studies, including a total of about 3500 pregnant women exposed to methylphenidate during the first trimester of pregnancy, have shown that the risk of cardiac malformations is probably greater in children of exposed mothers compared to those of non-exposed mothers: around 3 additional cases per 1000 pregnancies. When exposure to methylphenidate occurred during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, the risk of preeclampsia and premature birth seemed to be greater than in the absence of exposure.

					<td class="ab">Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents in the management of agitated behaviours following traumatic brain injury (TBI). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We performed a search strategy in PubMed, OvidMEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Directory of Open Access Journals, LILACS, Web of Science and Prospero (up to 10 December 2018) for published and unpublished evidence on the risks and benefits of 9 prespecified medications classes used to control agitated behaviours following TBI. We included all randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental and observational studies examining the effects of medications administered to control agitated behaviours in TBI patients. Included studies were classified into three mutually exclusive categories: (1) agitated behaviour was the presenting symptom; (2) agitated behaviour was not the presenting symptom, but was measured as an outcome variable; and (3) safety of pharmacological interventions administered to control agitated behaviours was measured. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Among the 181 articles assessed for eligibility, 21 studies were included. Of the studies suggesting possible benefits, propranolol reduced maximum intensities of agitation per week and physical restraint use, methylphenidate improved anger measures following 6 weeks of treatment, valproic acid reduced weekly agitated behaviour scale ratings and olanzapine reduced irritability, aggressiveness and insomnia between weeks 1 and 3 of treatment. Amantadine showed variable effects and may increase the risk of agitation in the critically ill. In three studies evaluating safety outcomes, antipsychotics were associated with an increased duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) in unadjusted analyses. Small sample sizes, heterogeneity and an unclear risk of bias were limits. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Propranolol, methylphenidate, valproic acid and olanzapine may offer some benefit; however, they need to be further studied. Antipsychotics may increase the length of PTA. More studies on tailored interventions and continuous evaluation of safety and efficacy throughout acute, rehabilitation and outpatient settings are needed.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Author(s).</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents in the management of agitated behaviours following traumatic brain injury (TBI). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We performed a search strategy in PubMed, OvidMEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Directory of Open Access Journals, LILACS, Web of Science and Prospero (up to 10 December 2018) for published and unpublished evidence on the risks and benefits of 9 prespecified medications classes used to control agitated behaviours following TBI. We included all randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental and observational studies examining the effects of medications administered to control agitated behaviours in TBI patients. Included studies were classified into three mutually exclusive categories: (1) agitated behaviour was the presenting symptom; (2) agitated behaviour was not the presenting symptom, but was measured as an outcome variable; and (3) safety of pharmacological interventions administered to control agitated behaviours was measured. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Among the 181 articles assessed for eligibility, 21 studies were included. Of the studies suggesting possible benefits, propranolol reduced maximum intensities of agitation per week and physical restraint use, methylphenidate improved anger measures following 6 weeks of treatment, valproic acid reduced weekly agitated behaviour scale ratings and olanzapine reduced irritability, aggressiveness and insomnia between weeks 1 and 3 of treatment. Amantadine showed variable effects and may increase the risk of agitation in the critically ill. In three studies evaluating safety outcomes, antipsychotics were associated with an increased duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) in unadjusted analyses. Small sample sizes, heterogeneity and an unclear risk of bias were limits. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Propranolol, methylphenidate, valproic acid and olanzapine may offer some benefit; however, they need to be further studied. Antipsychotics may increase the length of PTA. More studies on tailored interventions and continuous evaluation of safety and efficacy throughout acute, rehabilitation and outpatient settings are needed.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Author(s).</span><span>Pharmacological interventions for agitated behaviours in patients with traumatic brain injury: A systematic review</span></td>

This questionnaire explores socio-demographic data, consumption of tobacco, alcohol, psychoactive substances, NPS and questions about access to care and harm reduction in drug use. A first analysis was made on the data extracted from one of the largest techno festival in France. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): 70 subjects were interviewed: 50 men and 20 women. The average age is 26.5 years. 67 subjects reported having stable housing. 57 subjects are employed or students. 64 subjects reported no health problems. 66 people reported having used at least one psychoactive substance (excluding alcohol and tobacco) in the past 12 months. 204 substances were mentioned: cannabis (47), cocaine (36), ecstasy (34), MDMA (27), LSD (12), mushrooms (11), ketamine (7), speed (7), poppers (4), amphetamines (3), heroin (1), peyote (1), nitrous oxide (1), methylphenidate (1), clonazepam (1), salvia (1). 6 subjects reported consuming NPS during the year. Discussion/Conclusion: In a festival that attracts healthy and socially integrated young people, the number of consumers is very high and consumptions are multiple. Psychoactive substance use among young people is a real public health issue. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to access them. The analysis of these data makes visible the consumption of an invisible population in order to help decision-makers for priority public health programs and to target prevention actions on regional priorities by acting with populations at sensitive moments in their lives.</td>

					<td class="ab">Introduction: Exposure to a psychoactive substance (PAS) will have a different impact depending on age and PAS. However, data describing the PAS consumed according to the age of the subjects are rare. The aim of this work is to characterize the consumption of PAS in the youngest patients who have been the subject of an addictovigilance notification (NOTS). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): We extracted from the Nantes CEIP-A database all the NOTS registered from January 2008 to August 2018. A selection of NOTS concerning the 5th quantile of the youngest subjects was made and analyzed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): The 5th quantile of the youngest corresponds to subjects aged 17 or under. 354/6993 NOTS were reported for these patients. Five populations can be distinguished according to the age of the subject: (i) Newborns 1 month of age or younger (9.9%, n = 35): except for one, cases are related to neonatal withdrawal syndromes, mostly opiates; (ii) Babies aged 11 months to 2 years (4.8%, n = 17): all cases involve accidental poisoning with cannabis except 1 case with opioid substitution treatment (OST); (iii) Young children aged 4-8 years (4.5%, n = 16): these are mainly problematic consumptions of prescribed methylphenidate (PMP) (n = 14) with, in 6 cases, a non-therapeutic effect sought by the child; (iv) Children aged 9-13 years (15.0%, n = 53): most cases involve problematic use of PMP (n = 43) with a non-therapeutic effect sought by the child (n = 24).

					<td class="ab">Introduction: The use of methylphenidate in adults or during pregnancy is increasing in the USA and in Europe. The impulsivity associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might lead to an increased rate of unplanned pregnancy. Limited data are available concerning the malformative risk of methylphenidate however the suspension of treatment or inadequate treatment could also place both mother and baby at risk. Computerizing safety data about the use of methylphenidate during pregnancy is important. The objective of this study is to perform an updated quantitative metaanalysis of the risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) associated with methylphenidate exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Published reports and meeting abstracts were searched for in MEDLINE, Web of Science and PsycInfo up to December 2018. Bibliographic references list of all found studies, metaanalyses and reviews were hand-searched in order to identify additional eligible articles. All comparative cohort and case-control studies investigating the risk of MCM after methylphenidate exposure in early pregnancy were included. Pooled effect sizes with corresponding 95% CI were calculated using random effects models, comparing the risk of MCM between methylphenidate exposed and non-exposed pregnancies. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Five studies met the inclusion criteria, totaling 4,356,318 pregnancies and 4,132 exposed to methylphenidate. All studies were retrospective or prospective cohorts. First trimester exposure to methylphenidate was not significantly associated with an increased risk of MCM (pooled odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.83; 1.24). For cardiac malformations, an increased risk was found (pooled odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.04; 1.66). No heterogeneity between studies was observed (I&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; = 0%). Funnel plot was suggestive of publication bias. Discussion/Conclusion: This meta-analysis did not show an association between methylphenidate exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy and an increased risk of MCM. However, a lack of power cannot be ruled out. An increased risk of cardiac malformations was found and needs to be further evaluated.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Introduction: The use of methylphenidate in adults or during pregnancy is increasing in the USA and in Europe. The impulsivity associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might lead to an increased rate of unplanned pregnancy. Limited data are available concerning the malformative risk of methylphenidate however the suspension of treatment or inadequate treatment could also place both mother and baby at risk. Computerizing safety data about the use of methylphenidate during pregnancy is important. The objective of this study is to perform an updated quantitative metaanalysis of the risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) associated with methylphenidate exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Published reports and meeting abstracts were searched for in MEDLINE, Web of Science and PsycInfo up to December 2018. Bibliographic references list of all found studies, metaanalyses and reviews were hand-searched in order to identify additional eligible articles. All comparative cohort and case-control studies investigating the risk of MCM after methylphenidate exposure in early pregnancy were included. Pooled effect sizes with corresponding 95% CI were calculated using random effects models, comparing the risk of MCM between methylphenidate exposed and non-exposed pregnancies. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Five studies met the inclusion criteria, totaling 4,356,318 pregnancies and 4,132 exposed to methylphenidate. All studies were retrospective or prospective cohorts. First trimester exposure to methylphenidate was not significantly associated with an increased risk of MCM (pooled odds ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.83; 1.24). For cardiac malformations, an increased risk was found (pooled odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.04; 1.66). No heterogeneity between studies was observed (I&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; = 0%). Funnel plot was suggestive of publication bias. Discussion/Conclusion: This meta-analysis did not show an association between methylphenidate exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy and an increased risk of MCM. However, a lack of power cannot be ruled out. An increased risk of cardiac malformations was found and needs to be further evaluated.</span><span>Methylphenidate during pregnancy and the risk of congenital major malformations: A systematic review and meta-analysis</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Introduction: Literature on psychoactive substances use disorders (SUD) among seniors, over 64 years of age is scarce. Yet, the French Addictovigilance Network has recently become aware of the increase of psychoactive substances (PS) use among elderly. The objective of this work was to identify which PS are involved in SUD in French seniors. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): We used a multisource approach combining data from actors involved in the different aspects of the management of patients with SUD: pharmacoepidemiological tools for addictovigilance (Drames, Oppidum, Osiap [1]), case reports, national addictovigilance evaluations from 2014 to 2018. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Two main classes of drugs have been identified: (i) benzodiazepines (BZD), mainly zolpidem and zopiclone; (ii) opioid analgesics, in particular fentanyl (14% of the subjects included in the last addictovigilance evaluation on transdermal fentanyl are seniors) or oxycodone but also tramadol, opium powder, codeine, etc. These are often long-term exposures, leading to difficulty in stopping consumption mainly because of a withdrawal syndrome occurrence, with sometimes high doses, illegal acquisition (hidden consumption, falsified prescriptions), searching for a positive/euphoric effect. The prevalence of use of these two classes is high among seniors (27% for BZD [2], 14% for opioid analgesics [3] in 2013). Other SUD are emerging: with other medicines (methadone, venlafaxine, methylphenidate, ketamine) or non-medicine PS (cannabis, but also poppers, cocaine, heroin, methylone). The health issues are illustrated by hospitalizations for confusion, loss of consciousness, falls, respiratory disorders, SUD, and sometimes deaths. SUD can be managed in addiction care centers, as highlighted by the increase of seniors in the OPPIDUM survey from 2014 to 2017. Discussion/Conclusion: In France, PS abuse is diversifying both in terms of PS and users, and is no longer restricted to adolescents or young adults but can also affect older people, with sometimes severe consequences on health. Physician should be aware of these main recent trends to manage more efficiently SUD among seniors.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Introduction: Literature on psychoactive substances use disorders (SUD) among seniors, over 64 years of age is scarce. Yet, the French Addictovigilance Network has recently become aware of the increase of psychoactive substances (PS) use among elderly. The objective of this work was to identify which PS are involved in SUD in French seniors. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): We used a multisource approach combining data from actors involved in the different aspects of the management of patients with SUD: pharmacoepidemiological tools for addictovigilance (Drames, Oppidum, Osiap [1]), case reports, national addictovigilance evaluations from 2014 to 2018. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Two main classes of drugs have been identified: (i) benzodiazepines (BZD), mainly zolpidem and zopiclone; (ii) opioid analgesics, in particular fentanyl (14% of the subjects included in the last addictovigilance evaluation on transdermal fentanyl are seniors) or oxycodone but also tramadol, opium powder, codeine, etc. These are often long-term exposures, leading to difficulty in stopping consumption mainly because of a withdrawal syndrome occurrence, with sometimes high doses, illegal acquisition (hidden consumption, falsified prescriptions), searching for a positive/euphoric effect. The prevalence of use of these two classes is high among seniors (27% for BZD [2], 14% for opioid analgesics [3] in 2013). Other SUD are emerging: with other medicines (methadone, venlafaxine, methylphenidate, ketamine) or non-medicine PS (cannabis, but also poppers, cocaine, heroin, methylone). The health issues are illustrated by hospitalizations for confusion, loss of consciousness, falls, respiratory disorders, SUD, and sometimes deaths. SUD can be managed in addiction care centers, as highlighted by the increase of seniors in the OPPIDUM survey from 2014 to 2017. Discussion/Conclusion: In France, PS abuse is diversifying both in terms of PS and users, and is no longer restricted to adolescents or young adults but can also affect older people, with sometimes severe consequences on health. Physician should be aware of these main recent trends to manage more efficiently SUD among seniors.</span><span>Substance use disorders among French older adults: Main trends from the perspective of addictovigilance data</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Introduction: In the era of cyberculture, the Internet is used as a platform to promote and market drugs [1]. The aim of this work is to estimate the importance of the Internet to obtain drugs, and describe which drugs are concerned, using OPPIDUM data. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): OPPIDUM is a national and annual cross-sectional pharmaco-epidemiological survey [2]. It is based on addiction care centers that collect anonymous data on psychoactive substances consumed the previous week by patients with drug dependence or who benefit from an opiate maintenance treatment. For each psychoactive substance, ways of acquisition are specified (over-the-counter, prescription street market, forged prescription, theft, gift, Internet). This work analyzed psychoactive substances obtained over the Internet in 2017; these data were compared with 2007 data. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): In 2017, 11,054 psychoactive substances were consumed by 5,370 subjects (vs. 10,715 substances by 5,149 subjects in 2007). Internet acquisition was reported for 0.8% of psychoactive drugs (n = 83) by 57 subjects in 2017 (vs. 0.3% (n = 26) by 19 subjects in 2007). In 2017, main substances were not prescription drugs (89% in 2017 vs. 73% in 2007): cathinones (n = 23; 8 3-MMC, 5 4-MEC, 2 Mephedrone, 2 alpha-PVP and one report of Pentedrone, N ethylpentedrone, MDPV, MDPHP and 3-MEC), cannabis (n = 13), cocaine (n = 12), phenethylamines (n = 11; 5 Ecstasy, 4 amphetamine and 2 methamphetamine), tryptamine (n = 4, 3 LSD, 1 LSA), heroin (n = 3), hallucinogenic mushrooms (n = 2), cannabidiol (n = 2), GBL (n = 2), salvia (n = 1). Prescription drugs obtained on the Internet were Gamma-OH (GHB) (n = 2), Codeine (n = 2) and one report for others (methylphenidate, methadone, dextromethorphan, Clonazepam and buprenorphine). In 2007, half of the reported substances were cannabis and heroin. Discussion/Conclusion: According to the OPPIDUM survey, the acquisition of psychoactive substances from the Internet has been multiplied by 2 in ten years. This increase is mostly due to new psychoactive substances and less to prescription drugs. It is important to sensitize drug users on the risk associated with the use of drugs obtained through the Internet (side effects, composition may be different from those announced. .).</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Introduction: In the era of cyberculture, the Internet is used as a platform to promote and market drugs [1]. The aim of this work is to estimate the importance of the Internet to obtain drugs, and describe which drugs are concerned, using OPPIDUM data. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): OPPIDUM is a national and annual cross-sectional pharmaco-epidemiological survey [2]. It is based on addiction care centers that collect anonymous data on psychoactive substances consumed the previous week by patients with drug dependence or who benefit from an opiate maintenance treatment. For each psychoactive substance, ways of acquisition are specified (over-the-counter, prescription street market, forged prescription, theft, gift, Internet). This work analyzed psychoactive substances obtained over the Internet in 2017; these data were compared with 2007 data. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): In 2017, 11,054 psychoactive substances were consumed by 5,370 subjects (vs. 10,715 substances by 5,149 subjects in 2007). Internet acquisition was reported for 0.8% of psychoactive drugs (n = 83) by 57 subjects in 2017 (vs. 0.3% (n = 26) by 19 subjects in 2007). In 2017, main substances were not prescription drugs (89% in 2017 vs. 73% in 2007): cathinones (n = 23; 8 3-MMC, 5 4-MEC, 2 Mephedrone, 2 alpha-PVP and one report of Pentedrone, N ethylpentedrone, MDPV, MDPHP and 3-MEC), cannabis (n = 13), cocaine (n = 12), phenethylamines (n = 11; 5 Ecstasy, 4 amphetamine and 2 methamphetamine), tryptamine (n = 4, 3 LSD, 1 LSA), heroin (n = 3), hallucinogenic mushrooms (n = 2), cannabidiol (n = 2), GBL (n = 2), salvia (n = 1). Prescription drugs obtained on the Internet were Gamma-OH (GHB) (n = 2), Codeine (n = 2) and one report for others (methylphenidate, methadone, dextromethorphan, Clonazepam and buprenorphine). In 2007, half of the reported substances were cannabis and heroin. Discussion/Conclusion: According to the OPPIDUM survey, the acquisition of psychoactive substances from the Internet has been multiplied by 2 in ten years. This increase is mostly due to new psychoactive substances and less to prescription drugs. It is important to sensitize drug users on the risk associated with the use of drugs obtained through the Internet (side effects, composition may be different from those announced. .).</span><span>Internet, a new way of drug acquisition: Data from OPPIDUM survey</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Introduction: Methylphenidate (MPH) abuse increase in France and also in other European countries [1-3]. If the characteristics of its abuse are well described, few data are available on its serious health complications. We conducted an Addictovigilance study to describe more precisely this issue. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): In 2017, a questionnaire was sent to CSAPA and CAARUD addictions care centers of our area. This questionnaire explored the modalities of MPH use and serious health complications. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Among 27 centers, 10 reported at least one serious health complication occurring among 17 patients. The majority of patients use MPH by intravenous route and one by nasal route. Six patients were hospitalized in psychiatry (for acute psychotic state, risk of defenestration, paranoia, suicidal ideation, delusional thinking, hallucinations) and 6 had an infectious complications (5 abscesses including 1 complicated pulmonary embolism, 1 HCV seroconversion in a patient with no history of injection and stimulant use). One patient present a cardiovascular complication with a stroke (he was a daily consumer of cannabis and MPH at 1,200 mg/d) and one patient was hospitalized for withdrawal (he was injector of MPH and morphine and has presented psychotic decompensation during hospitalization). Three polydrug users who injected MPH died (one methadone user which has presented psychosis has done an overdose, one in a context of fire and one methadone user which has a medical history of infective endocarditis). Discussion/Conclusion: Given the increase of MPH use and its abuse, it is important to warn the scientific and medical community about serious psychiatric and somatic complications observed among MPH consumers.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Introduction: Methylphenidate (MPH) abuse increase in France and also in other European countries [1-3]. If the characteristics of its abuse are well described, few data are available on its serious health complications. We conducted an Addictovigilance study to describe more precisely this issue. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): In 2017, a questionnaire was sent to CSAPA and CAARUD addictions care centers of our area. This questionnaire explored the modalities of MPH use and serious health complications. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Among 27 centers, 10 reported at least one serious health complication occurring among 17 patients. The majority of patients use MPH by intravenous route and one by nasal route. Six patients were hospitalized in psychiatry (for acute psychotic state, risk of defenestration, paranoia, suicidal ideation, delusional thinking, hallucinations) and 6 had an infectious complications (5 abscesses including 1 complicated pulmonary embolism, 1 HCV seroconversion in a patient with no history of injection and stimulant use). One patient present a cardiovascular complication with a stroke (he was a daily consumer of cannabis and MPH at 1,200 mg/d) and one patient was hospitalized for withdrawal (he was injector of MPH and morphine and has presented psychotic decompensation during hospitalization). Three polydrug users who injected MPH died (one methadone user which has presented psychosis has done an overdose, one in a context of fire and one methadone user which has a medical history of infective endocarditis). Discussion/Conclusion: Given the increase of MPH use and its abuse, it is important to warn the scientific and medical community about serious psychiatric and somatic complications observed among MPH consumers.</span><span>Serious health complications related to methylphenidate abuse</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Computational models of reinforcement learning have helped dissect discrete components of reward-related function and characterize neurocognitive deficits in psychiatric illnesses. Stimulus novelty biases decision-making, even when unrelated to choice outcome, acting as if possessing intrinsic reward value to guide decisions toward uncertain options. Heightened novelty seeking is characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, yet how this influences reward-related decision-making is computationally encoded, or is altered by stimulant medication, is currently uncertain. Here we used an established reinforcement-learning task to model effects of novelty on reward-related behaviour during functional MRI in 30 adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 30 age-, sex- and IQ-matched control subjects. Each participant was tested on two separate occasions, once ON and once OFF stimulant medication. OFF medication, patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder showed significantly impaired task performance (P = 0.027), and greater selection of novel options (P = 0.004). Moreover, persistence in selecting novel options predicted impaired task performance (P = 0.025). These behavioural deficits were accompanied by a significantly lower learning rate (P = 0.011) and heightened novelty signalling within the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (family-wise error corrected P &lt; 0.05). Compared to effects in controls, stimulant medication improved attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participants&#039; overall task performance (P = 0.011), increased reward-learning rates (P = 0.046) and enhanced their ability to differentiate optimal from non-optimal novel choices (P = 0.032). It also reduced substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area responses to novelty. Preliminary cross-sectional evidence additionally suggested an association between long-term stimulant treatment and a reduction in the rewarding value of novelty. These data suggest that aberrant substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area novelty processing plays an important role in the suboptimal reward-related decision-making characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Compared to effects in controls, abnormalities in novelty processing and reward-related learning were improved by stimulant medication, suggesting that they may be disorder-specific targets for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) (2018).

					<td class="tw"><span>Computational models of reinforcement learning have helped dissect discrete components of reward-related function and characterize neurocognitive deficits in psychiatric illnesses. Stimulus novelty biases decision-making, even when unrelated to choice outcome, acting as if possessing intrinsic reward value to guide decisions toward uncertain options. Heightened novelty seeking is characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, yet how this influences reward-related decision-making is computationally encoded, or is altered by stimulant medication, is currently uncertain. Here we used an established reinforcement-learning task to model effects of novelty on reward-related behaviour during functional MRI in 30 adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 30 age-, sex- and IQ-matched control subjects. Each participant was tested on two separate occasions, once ON and once OFF stimulant medication. OFF medication, patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder showed significantly impaired task performance (P = 0.027), and greater selection of novel options (P = 0.004). Moreover, persistence in selecting novel options predicted impaired task performance (P = 0.025). These behavioural deficits were accompanied by a significantly lower learning rate (P = 0.011) and heightened novelty signalling within the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (family-wise error corrected P &lt; 0.05). Compared to effects in controls, stimulant medication improved attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participants&#039; overall task performance (P = 0.011), increased reward-learning rates (P = 0.046) and enhanced their ability to differentiate optimal from non-optimal novel choices (P = 0.032). It also reduced substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area responses to novelty. Preliminary cross-sectional evidence additionally suggested an association between long-term stimulant treatment and a reduction in the rewarding value of novelty. These data suggest that aberrant substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area novelty processing plays an important role in the suboptimal reward-related decision-making characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Compared to effects in controls, abnormalities in novelty processing and reward-related learning were improved by stimulant medication, suggesting that they may be disorder-specific targets for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) (2018).

					<td class="ab">One of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide is autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by language delay, impaired communication interactions, and repetitive patterns of behavior caused by environmental and genetic factors. This review aims to provide a comprehensive survey of recently published literature on ASD and especially novel insights into excitatory synaptic transmission. Even though numerous genes have been discovered that play roles in ASD, a good understanding of the pathophysiologic process of ASD is still lacking. The protein-protein interactions between the products of NLGN, SHANK, and NRXN synaptic genes indicate that the dysfunction in synaptic plasticity could be one reason for the development of ASD. Designing more accurate diagnostic tests for the early diagnosis of ASD would improve treatment strategies and could enhance the appropriate monitoring of prognosis. This comprehensive review describes the psychotropic and antiepileptic drugs that are currently available as effective pharmacological treatments and provides in-depth knowledge on the concepts related to clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and genetic perspectives of ASD. An increase in the prevalence of ASD in Gulf Cooperation Council countries is also addressed in the review. Further, the review emphasizes the need for international networking and multidimensional studies to design novel and effective treatment strategies.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 by the authors.

					<td class="tw"><span>One of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide is autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by language delay, impaired communication interactions, and repetitive patterns of behavior caused by environmental and genetic factors. This review aims to provide a comprehensive survey of recently published literature on ASD and especially novel insights into excitatory synaptic transmission. Even though numerous genes have been discovered that play roles in ASD, a good understanding of the pathophysiologic process of ASD is still lacking. The protein-protein interactions between the products of NLGN, SHANK, and NRXN synaptic genes indicate that the dysfunction in synaptic plasticity could be one reason for the development of ASD. Designing more accurate diagnostic tests for the early diagnosis of ASD would improve treatment strategies and could enhance the appropriate monitoring of prognosis. This comprehensive review describes the psychotropic and antiepileptic drugs that are currently available as effective pharmacological treatments and provides in-depth knowledge on the concepts related to clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and genetic perspectives of ASD. An increase in the prevalence of ASD in Gulf Cooperation Council countries is also addressed in the review. Further, the review emphasizes the need for international networking and multidimensional studies to design novel and effective treatment strategies.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 by the authors.

Participants underwent a comprehensive assessment of cognitive ability, adaptive skills and autism severity at toddlerhood and adolescence. More severe restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) in toddlerhood predicted the severity of Inattention symptoms. In addition, more severe RRB and lower adaptive skills in the toddler years significantly predicted the severity of Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptoms.

					<td class="tw"><span>High rates of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity have been described in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study searched for predictors at toddlerhood of the severity of ADHD symptoms at adolescence. The study included 65 participants, (mean age = 13:8 year), diagnosed with ASD at toddlerhood. Participants underwent a comprehensive assessment of cognitive ability, adaptive skills and autism severity at toddlerhood and adolescence. More severe restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) in toddlerhood predicted the severity of Inattention symptoms. In addition, more severe RRB and lower adaptive skills in the toddler years significantly predicted the severity of Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptoms. Adolescents with elevated ADHD symptoms diagnosed at toddlerhood with ASD showed lower cognitive and adaptive skills and more severe autism symptoms.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</span><span>From Toddlerhood to Adolescence: Which Characteristics Among Toddlers with Autism Spectrum Disorder Predict Adolescent Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Symptom Severity?

					<td class="ab">Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increases the risk of suicidal behaviours through psychiatric comorbidities; however, a significant direct association has not been observed between ADHD and suicide attempts. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Aim(s): To evaluate the risk of suicide attempt in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Using a nationwide, population-based insurance claims database, this longitudinal cohort study enrolled 20 574 adolescents and young adults with ADHD and 61 722 age-and gendermatched controls between 2001 and 2009. Any suicide attempt was identified from enrolment to 31 December 2011. The association between ADHD medications and the likelihood of suicide attempt was assessed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): ADHD was an independent risk factor for any suicide attempt (hazard ratio = 3.84, 95% CI = 3.19-4.62) and repeated suicide attempts (hazard ratio = 6.52, 95% CI = 4.46-9.53). Subgroup analyses of men, women, adolescents and young adults demonstrated the same trend. Methylphenidate or atomoxetine treatment did not increase the risk of suicide attempt or repeated suicide attempts. Long-term methylphenidate treatment was associated with a significantly decreased risk of repeated suicide attempts in men (hazard ratio = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.22-0.97). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): ADHD was a risk factor for suicide attempt and a stronger predictor of repeated suicide attempts, independent of comorbidities. Further investigation is warranted to explore the mechanism underlying the association between ADHD and suicidal behaviours.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2018.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increases the risk of suicidal behaviours through psychiatric comorbidities; however, a significant direct association has not been observed between ADHD and suicide attempts. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Aim(s): To evaluate the risk of suicide attempt in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Using a nationwide, population-based insurance claims database, this longitudinal cohort study enrolled 20 574 adolescents and young adults with ADHD and 61 722 age-and gendermatched controls between 2001 and 2009. Any suicide attempt was identified from enrolment to 31 December 2011. The association between ADHD medications and the likelihood of suicide attempt was assessed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): ADHD was an independent risk factor for any suicide attempt (hazard ratio = 3.84, 95% CI = 3.19-4.62) and repeated suicide attempts (hazard ratio = 6.52, 95% CI = 4.46-9.53). Subgroup analyses of men, women, adolescents and young adults demonstrated the same trend. Methylphenidate or atomoxetine treatment did not increase the risk of suicide attempt or repeated suicide attempts. Long-term methylphenidate treatment was associated with a significantly decreased risk of repeated suicide attempts in men (hazard ratio = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.22-0.97). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): ADHD was a risk factor for suicide attempt and a stronger predictor of repeated suicide attempts, independent of comorbidities. Further investigation is warranted to explore the mechanism underlying the association between ADHD and suicidal behaviours.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2018.</span><span>Risk of suicide attempts in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A nationwide longitudinal study</span></td>

We included patients with narcolepsy based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, 347. The case and matched control participants were selected in a ratio of 1:3, and the traffic accident (ICD-9-CM codes: E810-E819) plus injury codes (ICD-9-CM codes: 800.xx-999.xx) due to MVAI following hospitalization were used for the study outcome. The type of injury, causes, intentionality, and the effects of stimulant use on patients with narcolepsy were also assessed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): A total of 1,316 participants were enrolled, including 329 participants with narcolepsy and 987 participants without narcolepsy. During a 14-year follow-up period, a total of 104 participants had MVAI, of whom 47 (1,559.54 per 100,000 person-years) belonged to the narcolepsy cohort and 57 (556.21 per 100,000 person-years) to the non-narcolepsy cohort. After adjusting for covariates, the risk of hospitalization for MVAI among participants with narcolepsy was still significantly higher than those without narcolepsy (adjusted hazard ratio = 6.725; 95% confidence interval = 4.421-10.231; P &lt; .001). The use of modafinil or methylphenidate, as monotherapy or combined treatment, was associated with a lower risk of MVAI in the narcolepsy cohort. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Patients with narcolepsy may have a higher risk of hospitalization for MVAI and stimulant use could mitigate such risk.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

					<td class="tw"><span>Study Objectives: To examine the risk of hospitalization for motor vehicle accident injury (MVAI) in patients with narcolepsy and the effects of stimulant use on MVAI occurrence in patients with narcolepsy. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study using Taiwan&#039;s National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2013. We included patients with narcolepsy based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, 347. The case and matched control participants were selected in a ratio of 1:3, and the traffic accident (ICD-9-CM codes: E810-E819) plus injury codes (ICD-9-CM codes: 800.xx-999.xx) due to MVAI following hospitalization were used for the study outcome. The type of injury, causes, intentionality, and the effects of stimulant use on patients with narcolepsy were also assessed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): A total of 1,316 participants were enrolled, including 329 participants with narcolepsy and 987 participants without narcolepsy. During a 14-year follow-up period, a total of 104 participants had MVAI, of whom 47 (1,559.54 per 100,000 person-years) belonged to the narcolepsy cohort and 57 (556.21 per 100,000 person-years) to the non-narcolepsy cohort. After adjusting for covariates, the risk of hospitalization for MVAI among participants with narcolepsy was still significantly higher than those without narcolepsy (adjusted hazard ratio = 6.725; 95% confidence interval = 4.421-10.231; P &lt; .001). The use of modafinil or methylphenidate, as monotherapy or combined treatment, was associated with a lower risk of MVAI in the narcolepsy cohort. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Patients with narcolepsy may have a higher risk of hospitalization for MVAI and stimulant use could mitigate such risk.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

					<td class="ab">Aim: The aim of the present study was to characterize patterns of use of methylphenidate (MPH), a prescription stimulant medication recommended in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and of narcolepsy, in France, both in children and adults, over a 3-year period. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Using the French General Health Insurance database, limited to two areas covering approximately 4 million individuals, we made up a cohort of incident MPH users between July 2010 and June 2013. Splitting them into distinct age groups (18-24, 25-49 and &gt;=50 years of age for adults and &lt;6, 6-11 and 12-17 years of age for children), we established the characteristics of these populations at MPH initiation and during follow-up according to the duration of treatment, quantities dispensed and coprescription with central nervous system (CNS) drugs. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): We included a cohort of 3534 incident users, involving 30 238 dispensings of MPH, leading to an annual rate of 29 incident users per 100 000 in 2013. Children (66% of new users) were characterized by long-term use of MPH with few comedications. The group of 25-49-year-old patients were dispensed MPH more frequently than other groups, had the highest mean dose and were more often coprescribed other CNS drugs. The &gt;=50 year-old group was more often coprescribed antidepressants and antiparkinsonian drugs. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our pharmacoepidemiological study involving incident MPH users with a large number of characteristics showed different patterns of MPH use among children and adults. The results from the 25-49-year-old group suggested that MPH might be being used for medical conditions other than ADHD or narcolepsy in adults, and that it might be subject to misuse and/or abuse.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 The British Pharmacological Society</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Aim: The aim of the present study was to characterize patterns of use of methylphenidate (MPH), a prescription stimulant medication recommended in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and of narcolepsy, in France, both in children and adults, over a 3-year period. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Using the French General Health Insurance database, limited to two areas covering approximately 4 million individuals, we made up a cohort of incident MPH users between July 2010 and June 2013. Splitting them into distinct age groups (18-24, 25-49 and &gt;=50 years of age for adults and &lt;6, 6-11 and 12-17 years of age for children), we established the characteristics of these populations at MPH initiation and during follow-up according to the duration of treatment, quantities dispensed and coprescription with central nervous system (CNS) drugs. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): We included a cohort of 3534 incident users, involving 30 238 dispensings of MPH, leading to an annual rate of 29 incident users per 100 000 in 2013. Children (66% of new users) were characterized by long-term use of MPH with few comedications. The group of 25-49-year-old patients were dispensed MPH more frequently than other groups, had the highest mean dose and were more often coprescribed other CNS drugs. The &gt;=50 year-old group was more often coprescribed antidepressants and antiparkinsonian drugs. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our pharmacoepidemiological study involving incident MPH users with a large number of characteristics showed different patterns of MPH use among children and adults. The results from the 25-49-year-old group suggested that MPH might be being used for medical conditions other than ADHD or narcolepsy in adults, and that it might be subject to misuse and/or abuse.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 The British Pharmacological Society</span><span>Patterns and profiles of methylphenidate use both in children and adults</span><span>concerta</span><span>medikinet</span><span>quasym</span><span>ritalin</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Objective: Sleep disturbances are a feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and an adverse event (AE) of methylphenidate treatment. The authors sought to clarify methylphenidate-associated sleep problems and how studies are affected by confounding factors. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Data Sources: Published studies in English collected via online databases and unpublished data from www.clinicaltrials.gov and US Food and Drug Administration websites. Sources were searched from inception to August 2017. Study Selection: Included were blinded placebo-controlled studies of youth with ADHD conducted in naturalistic settings, leading to 35 studies yielding 75 observations of sleep-related AEs. These studies comprised 3,079 drugexposed and 2,606 placebo-treated patients. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Data Extraction: Two PhD-level reviewers reviewed each study for inclusion. Four PhD/PharmD-level reviewers extracted data in duplicate. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or, if needed, by the senior author. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Increased pooled relative risks (RRs) were found for methylphenidate-associated sleep-related AEs for insomnia (general), initial insomnia, middle insomnia, combined insomnia, and sleep disorder. Several sample or study design features were significantly associated with the RR for sleep-related AEs and the methylphenidate formulation studied (P &lt; .05). After correction for confounding variables, significant differences among drugs were found for initial insomnia, insomnia (general), and sleep disorder (P &lt; .0001) as the other categories could not be tested due to insufficient studies. The findings also show that the RR and its interpretation are constrained by the placebo AE rate. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Several types of insomnia and sleep problems are associated with methylphenidate treatment. Study design and sample features influence the RR statistic. By showing that the rate of placebo AEs impacts the RR, this study provides the field with a useful covariate for adjusting RR statistics.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2019 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objective: Sleep disturbances are a feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and an adverse event (AE) of methylphenidate treatment. The authors sought to clarify methylphenidate-associated sleep problems and how studies are affected by confounding factors. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Data Sources: Published studies in English collected via online databases and unpublished data from www.clinicaltrials.gov and US Food and Drug Administration websites. Sources were searched from inception to August 2017. Study Selection: Included were blinded placebo-controlled studies of youth with ADHD conducted in naturalistic settings, leading to 35 studies yielding 75 observations of sleep-related AEs. These studies comprised 3,079 drugexposed and 2,606 placebo-treated patients. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Data Extraction: Two PhD-level reviewers reviewed each study for inclusion. Four PhD/PharmD-level reviewers extracted data in duplicate. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or, if needed, by the senior author. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Increased pooled relative risks (RRs) were found for methylphenidate-associated sleep-related AEs for insomnia (general), initial insomnia, middle insomnia, combined insomnia, and sleep disorder. Several sample or study design features were significantly associated with the RR for sleep-related AEs and the methylphenidate formulation studied (P &lt; .05). After correction for confounding variables, significant differences among drugs were found for initial insomnia, insomnia (general), and sleep disorder (P &lt; .0001) as the other categories could not be tested due to insufficient studies. The findings also show that the RR and its interpretation are constrained by the placebo AE rate. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Several types of insomnia and sleep problems are associated with methylphenidate treatment. Study design and sample features influence the RR statistic. By showing that the rate of placebo AEs impacts the RR, this study provides the field with a useful covariate for adjusting RR statistics.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2019 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</span><span>Sleep-associated adverse events during methylphenidate treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A meta-analysis</span></td>

					<td class="ab">The aim of the present work is to investigate the association of salivary and cumulative cortisol levels with emotional and behavioral symptoms in a Franconian Cognition and Emotion Studies (FRANCES) general population cohort of 158 6- to 9 year old children. Salivary cortisol values were measured by one-day diurnal cortisol profile, whereas cumulative cortisol was estimated via one-month hair cortisol concentrations (rHCC). Nearly all significant associations of clinical symptoms with child cortisol indices were age dependent: We report emotional symptoms being associated with lower rHCC in younger children (6.06-7.54 years). In older children (7.55-9.41 years) behavioral problems were further associated with higher rHCC and lower salivary cortisol awakening responses. In summary, child clinical symptoms were stronger associated with markers of hair cortisol compared to salivary cortisol. To picture developmental mechanisms, we suggest longitudinal designs for cortisol measures of stress systems in children and adolescents.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Inc.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>The aim of the present work is to investigate the association of salivary and cumulative cortisol levels with emotional and behavioral symptoms in a Franconian Cognition and Emotion Studies (FRANCES) general population cohort of 158 6- to 9 year old children. Salivary cortisol values were measured by one-day diurnal cortisol profile, whereas cumulative cortisol was estimated via one-month hair cortisol concentrations (rHCC). Nearly all significant associations of clinical symptoms with child cortisol indices were age dependent: We report emotional symptoms being associated with lower rHCC in younger children (6.06-7.54 years). In older children (7.55-9.41 years) behavioral problems were further associated with higher rHCC and lower salivary cortisol awakening responses. In summary, child clinical symptoms were stronger associated with markers of hair cortisol compared to salivary cortisol. To picture developmental mechanisms, we suggest longitudinal designs for cortisol measures of stress systems in children and adolescents.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Inc.</span><span>Salivary and hair cortisol as biomarkers of emotional and behavioral symptoms in 6-9year old children</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background: A reduced willingness to perform effort based on the magnitude and probability of potential rewards has been associated with diminished dopamine function and may be relevant to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here, we investigated the influence of ADHD status and methylphenidate on effort-based decisions. We hypothesized that ADHD participants would make fewer high-effort selections than non-ADHD subjects, and that methylphenidate would increase the number of high-effort selections. Furthermore, we hypothesized there would be associations among ADHD severity and methylphenidate-related changes in effort-based and attentional performance across all participants. Methods and participants: ADHD (n = 23) and non-ADHD (n = 23) adults completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task in which participants select between low-effort and high-effort options to receive monetary rewards at varying levels of reward magnitude and probability. A test of attentional performance was also completed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Overall, participants made more high-effort selections as potential reward magnitude and probability increased. ADHD participants did not make fewer high-effort selections than non-ADHD participants, but ADHD participants showed greater methylphenidate-related increases in high-effort selections. ADHD participants had worse attentional performance than non-ADHD participants. ADHD severity was associated with methylphenidate-related changes in high-effort selections, but not changes in attentional performance. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): These results indicate that methylphenidate increases the willingness to perform effort in individuals with ADHD, possibly due to disorder-related motivational deficits.

Two urinals were placed at music stages with late-night concerts, and one urinal was placed at a camp site. Samples were prepared using enzymatic hydrolysis followed by cationic and anionic solid phase extraction, and analysed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-HR-TOF-MS).

The recreational drugs identified were amphetamine (n = 30), cocaine (n = 44), MDA (n = 40), MDMA (n = 44), THC-COOH (n = 19) and ketamine (n = 17). No NPS were identified. Sample testing using the urine drug-screening immunoassays showed presence of cocaine (n = 27), methamphetamine/MDMA (n = 4), THC (n = 7), &#034;Spice&#034; (n = 7) and methylphenidate (n = 1). These discrepancies might be caused by differences in cut-off values between the analytical methods, limited specificity or cross-reactivity of the urine drug-screening immunoassays compared to UPLC-HR-TOFMS results. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Widespread uses of classical recreational drugs were identified in pooled urine samples.

					<td class="ab">BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with methylphenidate or desmopressin (dDAVP) in patients with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and enuresis. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;METHOD(S): We enrolled 103 patients affected by ADHD and 125 patients with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NE). Data were collected between January 2014 and December 2015. The study was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;RESULT(S): About children with ADHD, 9/103 (8.7%) were also suffering from NE; of those 8/9 followed treatment with methylphenidate and cognitive behavioral therapy. After 3 months 2/8 (25%, CI 95%: 8-65%) showed improvements, remaining 75% has been increased dosage of methylphenidate. After 6 months a response was achieved in 6/8 (75%, CI 95%: 35-96%) children and 1/8 was lost to follow-up. Furthermore the drug withdrawal showed a recurrence of symptoms both ADHD and NE in 1/7 (14.3%, CI 95%: 0.3-57%) vs. 6/7 (85.7%, CI 95%: 42-99%) that not presented recurrences. About children with NE enrolled at Campus Bio-Medico University it was found that 4/125 (3.8%) children were also suffering from ADHD; 3/4 (75%) treated with dDAVP and motivational therapy, of those 2/3 (66.7%, CI 95%: 9-99%) showed no improvements of symptoms vs. 1/3 (33.3%, CI 95%: 0.8-90%) that showed partial response with a reduction of wet-nights. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;CONCLUSION(S): It is important the service of recruitment of patients with NE. In fact considering NE in a Child Neuropsychiatry Service where patients belong to a diagnosis of ADHD and NE is an incidental finding, this one is not considered as the addressee of treatment, but the therapy is directed to the neuro-behavioral problem using specific drugs and therapies, which are resolutive in the enuretic disorder.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.</td>

					<td class="ab">At the recent American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) meeting, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals and PsychoGenics Inc. announced positive Phase 2 results for SEP-363856, a novel, first-in-class treatment that has the potential to offer patients with schizophrenia the chance to live a near-normal life. Available treatment options fail to treat all schizophrenia symptoms, and their side effects result in non-compliance and relapse. SEP-363856, by contrast, shows robust effects across a broad range of disabling symptoms, including positive, negative, depressive, and general psychopathology symptoms, with a safety profile similar to placebo. Discovered via SmartCube, PsychoGenics&#039; target-agnostic platform, SEP-363856 does not interact with the dopamine D2 or other neuroreceptors thought to mediate the effects of currently available antipsychotic agents. The SmartCube platform thus represents a novel approach to discovering the next generation of breakthrough treatments for schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Drug Delivery Technology.

					<td class="ab">Objective This article elucidates a clinical and genetic approach to pediatric early-onset chorea in patients with normal neuroimaging. Methods We retrospectively studied patients with onset hyperkinetic movement disorders. Only children with onset of chorea in the first 3 years of life were included, those with an abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG) were excluded. We studied the movement disorder phenotype by clinical examination and by interpretation of videos and compared our data to the literature. Results Four patients, aged 2 to 13 years, were diagnosed. Abnormal involuntary movements appeared between the ages of 6 months to 3 years in association with developmental delay. One patient has a close relative with NKX2.1 -related chorea. One patient is from Iraqi-Jewish origin. Facial twitches and nocturnal dyskinetic attacks were observed in one. The unique clinical presentation and family history enabled genetic diagnosis by molecular analysis of a specific mutation in two (NKX2.1, OPA3) and Sanger sequencing of a target gene in one (ADCY5). One patient was diagnosed by whole-exome sequencing (WES) (GNAO1). Conclusion By carefully recording the phenotype and genetic background, a single gene can be suspected in some cases. In the rest, we suggest multigene panels or WES study.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objective This article elucidates a clinical and genetic approach to pediatric early-onset chorea in patients with normal neuroimaging. Methods We retrospectively studied patients with onset hyperkinetic movement disorders. Only children with onset of chorea in the first 3 years of life were included, those with an abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG) were excluded. We studied the movement disorder phenotype by clinical examination and by interpretation of videos and compared our data to the literature. Results Four patients, aged 2 to 13 years, were diagnosed. Abnormal involuntary movements appeared between the ages of 6 months to 3 years in association with developmental delay. One patient has a close relative with NKX2.1 -related chorea. One patient is from Iraqi-Jewish origin. Facial twitches and nocturnal dyskinetic attacks were observed in one. The unique clinical presentation and family history enabled genetic diagnosis by molecular analysis of a specific mutation in two (NKX2.1, OPA3) and Sanger sequencing of a target gene in one (ADCY5). One patient was diagnosed by whole-exome sequencing (WES) (GNAO1). Conclusion By carefully recording the phenotype and genetic background, a single gene can be suspected in some cases. In the rest, we suggest multigene panels or WES study.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.</span><span>Multiple Causes of Pediatric Early Onset Chorea--Clinical and Genetic Approach</span></td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) is used to treat a wide range of malignant and benign conditions and is associated with a unique set of risks and complications. Early complications from CRT include fatigue, skin reaction, alopecia, headaches, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, exacerbation of neurologic symptoms, serous otitis media, parotitis, and encephalopathy. Delayed complications include pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis, neurocognitive changes, cerebrovascular effects, migrainelike disorders, cataracts, xerophthalmia, optic neuropathy, hearing loss, tinnitus, chronic otitis, endocrinopathy, and secondary malignancy.

					<td class="ab">4-Fluoromethylphenidate (4F-MPH) is an halogenated derivative of methylphenidate (MPH), a reuptake inhibitor for dopamine and norepinephrine used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. In the last few years, several compounds structurally related to MPH have been marked as new psychoactive substances (NPS) with stimulating and euphoric effects similar to the parent drug, but with more dopaminergic activity. This report represents the first case of an analytically confirmed non-fatal intoxication by 4F-MPH. A 26-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department with neuropsychiatric and cardiologic symptoms that lasted for a week, during which she sniffed a powder named 4F-MPH acquired as entactogen on the Internet. The patient required sedation with intravenous diazepam and was discharged two days later with a prescription of promazine and quetiapine. The seized product was analytically characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. These analyses confirmed the composition of the product as a 4F-MPH diastereomeric Threo and erythro mixture, with a large preponderance of the active Threo isomer. A minimal validation, intended for rare analytes, was performed for the quantification of 4F-MPH in the biological samples by liquid chromatography-Tandem mass spectrometry. Accuracy (bias) and precision were within 15% for both blood and urine. The blood and urine concentration of Threo 4F-MPH were 32 ng/mL and 827 ng/mL, respectively. Analyses for classic drugs (opiates, methadone, cocaine, cannabis metabolites, amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD), ethanol, qualitative full screen by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and targeted analysis for 50 NPS by liquid chromatography-Tandem mass spectrometry tested negative; comorbidities were excluded, too. Based on these data, it can be assumed that the clinical manifestations were due to 4F-MPH only.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.

					<td class="ab">Brain tissue may serve as a useful supplement to blood in postmortem investigations. However, reference concentrations for central stimulant drugs are scarce in brain tissue. This study involves some frequently used stimulants: Amphetamine, cocaine, ephedrine, MDMA and methylphenidate. We present concentrations from brain and blood and brain-blood ratios of the analytes from autopsies. The cases were grouped according to the cause of death: A: The compound solely caused a fatal intoxication. B: The compound contributed to a fatal outcome in combination with other drugs, alcohol or disease. C: The compound was not related to the cause of death. Analyses were carried out using solid-phase extraction and ultra high-performance liquid chromatography. Paired brain and femoral blood concentrations from 133 cases were analysed. Positive correlations were observed for all analytes with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.58 to 0.95. The following median brain-blood ratios were obtained: cocaine 2.0 (range 0.20-7.0), amphetamine 3.2 (range 1.5-4.5), ephedrine 2.3 (range 1.1-6.2), MDMA 3.9 (range 0.92-5.1) and methylphenidate 2.4 (0.92-4.6). The concentrations in femoral blood generally agreed with the literature for all compounds. The metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, was also quantified in brain and blood from 60 cases, and the median brain-blood ratio was 0.66 with 10-90 percentiles of 0.39-1.27. The results of this study can aid the toxicological investigation in determining the cause of death.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.

					<td class="tw"><span>Brain tissue may serve as a useful supplement to blood in postmortem investigations. However, reference concentrations for central stimulant drugs are scarce in brain tissue. This study involves some frequently used stimulants: Amphetamine, cocaine, ephedrine, MDMA and methylphenidate. We present concentrations from brain and blood and brain-blood ratios of the analytes from autopsies. The cases were grouped according to the cause of death: A: The compound solely caused a fatal intoxication. B: The compound contributed to a fatal outcome in combination with other drugs, alcohol or disease. C: The compound was not related to the cause of death. Analyses were carried out using solid-phase extraction and ultra high-performance liquid chromatography. Paired brain and femoral blood concentrations from 133 cases were analysed. Positive correlations were observed for all analytes with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.58 to 0.95. The following median brain-blood ratios were obtained: cocaine 2.0 (range 0.20-7.0), amphetamine 3.2 (range 1.5-4.5), ephedrine 2.3 (range 1.1-6.2), MDMA 3.9 (range 0.92-5.1) and methylphenidate 2.4 (0.92-4.6). The concentrations in femoral blood generally agreed with the literature for all compounds. The metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, was also quantified in brain and blood from 60 cases, and the median brain-blood ratio was 0.66 with 10-90 percentiles of 0.39-1.27. The results of this study can aid the toxicological investigation in determining the cause of death.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.

					<td class="ab">Women in secure forensic mental health care require therapy and care that is responsive to their specific needs. Despite the policy recognition that women require a distinct service, evidence based practice is not available for this population. This review was undertaken in response to a clinical need within a medium secure unit in Glasgow that was experiencing high levels of challenging behaviour, in a female ward. The review aimed to identify effective strategies or interventions for the management of challenging behaviour in women in secure services and, therefore, improve practice and patient care. A synthesis of the findings from the 11 identified studies revealed variability in the approaches used to support women in forensic services, including: behavioural programmes; organisational change with a focus on staff training and support; medication; ECT and mechanical restraint. The challenging behaviours assessed included self-harm; physical and verbal aggression; suicide attempts and arson/fire setting. The majority of articles suggested some improvement in aspects of challenging behaviour, however this was limited by the lack of control groups and small sample sizes. Further investigation is required to find out whether interventions identified in this review can sustain a reduction in challenging behaviours in the long-term.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, &amp;#xa9; 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Women in secure forensic mental health care require therapy and care that is responsive to their specific needs. Despite the policy recognition that women require a distinct service, evidence based practice is not available for this population. This review was undertaken in response to a clinical need within a medium secure unit in Glasgow that was experiencing high levels of challenging behaviour, in a female ward. The review aimed to identify effective strategies or interventions for the management of challenging behaviour in women in secure services and, therefore, improve practice and patient care. A synthesis of the findings from the 11 identified studies revealed variability in the approaches used to support women in forensic services, including: behavioural programmes; organisational change with a focus on staff training and support; medication; ECT and mechanical restraint. The challenging behaviours assessed included self-harm; physical and verbal aggression; suicide attempts and arson/fire setting. The majority of articles suggested some improvement in aspects of challenging behaviour, however this was limited by the lack of control groups and small sample sizes. Further investigation is required to find out whether interventions identified in this review can sustain a reduction in challenging behaviours in the long-term.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, &amp;#xa9; 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</span><span>A systematic review of effective therapeutic interventions and management strategies for challenging behaviour in women in forensic mental health settings</span></td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Purpose of Review: To understand the impact of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its medications on blood pressure (BP) in children and adolescents and provide recommendations for management of elevated BP in children and adolescents with ADHD. Recent Findings: ADHD medications have cardiovascular effects including elevated BP. However, the bulk of the evidence indicates that stimulants and other ADHD medications are safe and do not cause severe cardiovascular diseases. BP should be assessed carefully at the time of ADHD diagnosis, because some behavioral changes similar to ADHD may be associated with hypertension. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Summary: ADHD medications appear to be safe. However, their long-term impact on the cardiovascular system is not clearly understood and needs further investigation. BP should be monitored regularly during ADHD pharmacotherapy in order to optimize the management of both conditions.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</span><span>Evaluation and Management of Elevated Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Objective: Children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently have comorbidities that are potential indications for antipsychotics (APs). Some studies have suggested that the combined use of methylphenidate (MPH) and APs is increasing in this population group. Longitudinal analyses and in-depth investigations on the substance level are lacking. This study aimed to estimate the cumulative proportion of concomitant AP/MPH use in children and adolescents with ADHD over a follow-up of up to 9 years and to describe patient characteristics stratified by specific AP drug. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Based on claims data, concomitant AP/MPH use was identified among 67,595 children and adolescents with ADHD starting MPH treatment between 2005 and 2013. Characteristics and diagnoses-including those indicating appropriateness of AP use according to approved indications and/or guidelines-were examined at the time of first AP/MPH combination therapy. In addition, subsequent use of AP/MPH combination therapy was evaluated. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): The cumulative proportion of individuals with any AP/MPH combination therapy rose to over 6% within 9 years after initiating MPH. The most frequent APs first used in combination with MPH were risperidone (72%), pipamperone (15%), and tiapride (8%). Percentages of psychiatric hospitalization in the year preceding the first combination therapy with MPH were 33%, 43%, and 19%, respectively. The proportion of individuals with potentially appropriate use was high (&gt;72%) in risperidone/MPH and tiapride/MPH and low (15%) in pipamperone/MPH combination users. Conduct disorders and tic disorders were frequent in users who were prescribed MPH with risperidone and tiapride, respectively. One-quarter of patients with AP/MPH combination therapy were one-time-only combination users. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that a considerable proportion of children and adolescents with ADHD receive MPH in combination with APs and that this is a factor not only during the first years of MPH treatment. ADHD guidelines should specify algorithms concerning the use of AP medication.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</td>

					<td class="ab">Objectives: We investigated the effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in Asian children and adolescents (6-17 years) with autistic disorder in a 12-week, multinational, multicenter, open-label study. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Sixty-seven subjects (10.0 +/- 3.1 years old, 52 boys) were enrolled and treated with flexibly dosed aripiprazole for 12 weeks (mean dose, 5.1 +/- 2.5 mg; range 2-15 mg). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Aripiprazole significantly reduced the mean caregiver-rated scores for the Irritability, Lethargy/Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, and Inappropriate Speech subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist from baseline to week 12 (p &lt; 0.001 for all subscales). Clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness scale score also improved from baseline through week 12 (p &lt; 0.001). The most common adverse event was weight gain and no serious adverse event related to aripiprazole treatment was noted. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that aripiprazole is effective and generally tolerable in the treatment of irritability in Asian children and adolescents with autistic disorder. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer treatment durations are required.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objectives: We investigated the effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in Asian children and adolescents (6-17 years) with autistic disorder in a 12-week, multinational, multicenter, open-label study. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Sixty-seven subjects (10.0 +/- 3.1 years old, 52 boys) were enrolled and treated with flexibly dosed aripiprazole for 12 weeks (mean dose, 5.1 +/- 2.5 mg; range 2-15 mg). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Aripiprazole significantly reduced the mean caregiver-rated scores for the Irritability, Lethargy/Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, and Inappropriate Speech subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist from baseline to week 12 (p &lt; 0.001 for all subscales). Clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness scale score also improved from baseline through week 12 (p &lt; 0.001). The most common adverse event was weight gain and no serious adverse event related to aripiprazole treatment was noted. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that aripiprazole is effective and generally tolerable in the treatment of irritability in Asian children and adolescents with autistic disorder. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer treatment durations are required.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</span><span>Aripiprazole for Irritability in Asian Children and Adolescents with Autistic Disorder: A 12-Week, Multinational, Multicenter, Prospective Open-Label Study</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of l-carnosine as an add-on to methylphenidate in management of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): This was an 8-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty-six drug-free children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old with a diagnosis of ADHD entered the study. The patients were randomly assigned to l-carnosine (800 mg/d in two divided doses) or placebo plus methylphenidate (0.5-1.5 mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks. Children were assessed using the Teacher and Parent ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) at baseline and at weeks 4 and 8 postbaseline. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Fifty patients completed the study, and all had two postbaseline measurements. Using the general linear model repeated measures, significant effect was observed for time x treatment interaction on total and inattention subscales of the Parent ADHD-RS (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected: F = 3.783, df = 1.444, p = 0.041 and F = 4.032, df = 1.600, p = 0.030). Improvements in the Teacher ADHD-RS were not significantly different between the two groups in total (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected: F = 0.200, df = 1.218, p = 0.705), as well as inattention and hyperactivity subscale scores (p = 0.956 and 0.281, respectively). The frequency of side effects was not significantly different between the two treatment arms. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): l-carnosine, as a supplementary medication, might be beneficial in treatment of children with ADHD. However, further investigations and different doses of l-carnosine are required to replicate these findings in children with ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of l-carnosine as an add-on to methylphenidate in management of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): This was an 8-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty-six drug-free children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old with a diagnosis of ADHD entered the study. The patients were randomly assigned to l-carnosine (800 mg/d in two divided doses) or placebo plus methylphenidate (0.5-1.5 mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks. Children were assessed using the Teacher and Parent ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) at baseline and at weeks 4 and 8 postbaseline. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Fifty patients completed the study, and all had two postbaseline measurements. Using the general linear model repeated measures, significant effect was observed for time x treatment interaction on total and inattention subscales of the Parent ADHD-RS (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected: F = 3.783, df = 1.444, p = 0.041 and F = 4.032, df = 1.600, p = 0.030). Improvements in the Teacher ADHD-RS were not significantly different between the two groups in total (Greenhouse-Geisser corrected: F = 0.200, df = 1.218, p = 0.705), as well as inattention and hyperactivity subscale scores (p = 0.956 and 0.281, respectively). The frequency of side effects was not significantly different between the two treatment arms. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): l-carnosine, as a supplementary medication, might be beneficial in treatment of children with ADHD. However, further investigations and different doses of l-carnosine are required to replicate these findings in children with ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</span><span>L-Carnosine as Adjunctive Therapy in Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial</span></td>

MPH ERCT was initiated at 20 mg/day; participants were titrated in 10-20 mg/day increments weekly based on efficacy and tolerability (maximum dose, 60 mg/day). Dose-optimization period efficacy assessments included the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), analyzed by week in a post hoc analysis using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures with final optimized dose (20, 30/40, or 50/60 mg), visit, final optimized dose and visit interaction, and baseline score as terms. Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications were collected throughout the study. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Mean MPH ERCT daily dose increased weekly from 29.4 mg/day after the first dose adjustment at week 1 (n = 90) to 42.8 mg/day after the final adjustment at week 5 (n = 86). Final optimized MPH ERCT dose ranged from 20 to 60 mg/day. Mean final optimized MPH ERCT dose ranged from 40.0 mg/day in 6-8 year-old participants to 44.8 mg/day for 11-12 year-old participants. There was a progressive decrease in mean (standard deviation) ADHD-RS-IV total score from 40.1 (8.72) at baseline to 12.4 (7.88) at OL week 5, with similar improvement patterns for hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscale scores. Participants optimized to MPH ERCT 50/60 mg/day had a significantly higher mean (standard error) ADHD-RS-IV score at baseline compared with participants optimized to MPH ERCT 20 mg/day (42.4 [1.34] vs. 35.1 [2.55]; p = 0.013). Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 65/90 (72.2%) participants in the dose-optimization period. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Dose-optimization period results describing relationships between change in ADHD symptom scores and final optimized MPH ERCT dose will be valuable for clinicians optimizing MPH ERCT dose.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Sharon B.

					<td class="tw"><span>Objective: To examine methylphenidate extended-release chewable tablets (MPH ERCT) dose patterns, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom scores, and safety during the 6-week, open-label (OL) dose-optimization period of a phase 3, laboratory classroom study. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Boys and girls (6-12 years) diagnosed with ADHD were enrolled. MPH ERCT was initiated at 20 mg/day; participants were titrated in 10-20 mg/day increments weekly based on efficacy and tolerability (maximum dose, 60 mg/day). Dose-optimization period efficacy assessments included the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), analyzed by week in a post hoc analysis using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures with final optimized dose (20, 30/40, or 50/60 mg), visit, final optimized dose and visit interaction, and baseline score as terms. Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications were collected throughout the study. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Mean MPH ERCT daily dose increased weekly from 29.4 mg/day after the first dose adjustment at week 1 (n = 90) to 42.8 mg/day after the final adjustment at week 5 (n = 86). Final optimized MPH ERCT dose ranged from 20 to 60 mg/day. Mean final optimized MPH ERCT dose ranged from 40.0 mg/day in 6-8 year-old participants to 44.8 mg/day for 11-12 year-old participants. There was a progressive decrease in mean (standard deviation) ADHD-RS-IV total score from 40.1 (8.72) at baseline to 12.4 (7.88) at OL week 5, with similar improvement patterns for hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness subscale scores. Participants optimized to MPH ERCT 50/60 mg/day had a significantly higher mean (standard error) ADHD-RS-IV score at baseline compared with participants optimized to MPH ERCT 20 mg/day (42.4 [1.34] vs. 35.1 [2.55]; p = 0.013). Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 65/90 (72.2%) participants in the dose-optimization period. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Dose-optimization period results describing relationships between change in ADHD symptom scores and final optimized MPH ERCT dose will be valuable for clinicians optimizing MPH ERCT dose.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Sharon B.

					<td class="ab">Aims: Recreational use of novel psychoactive substance (NPS) has become increasingly common. We aimed to assess the association of national legislation and local trading standards activity with hospital presentations. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We established observational cohorts of patients with recreational drug toxicity presenting to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and dying with detectable recreational drugs in Edinburgh. We assessed associations with two temporary class drug-orders (April 2015: methylphenidates, Nov 2015: methiopropamine), the Psychoactive Substances Act (June 2016), and trading standards forfeiture orders (October 2015). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): The methylphenidate temporary class drug-order was associated with rapid 46.7% (P = 0.002) and 21.0% (P = 0.003) reductions in presentations and admissions, respectively, for NPS drug toxicity, comparing 12 months before with 6 months after. The change was greatest for ethylphenidate toxicity (96.7% reduction in admissions, P &lt; 0.001) that was partly offset by a tripling in synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist cases (P &lt; 0.001) over the next 6 months. This increase reversed following trading standards activity removing all NPS drugs from local shops in October 2015, associated with 64.3% (P &lt; 0.001) and 83.7% (P &lt; 0.001) reductions in presentations and admissions, respectively, for all NPS drugs over the next 12 months. The effect was sustained and associated with a reduced postmortem detection of stimulant NPS drugs.

					<td class="ab">Behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia are highly prevalent and are associated with an increased risk of institutionalization and mortality. Current pharmacological treatments for these symptoms include cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. When used for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia, they are associated with limited efficacy and/or serious adverse events. As such, there has been extensive research into novel agents with varying mechanisms of action targeting behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia. In this article, we present the results of a comprehensive literature search and review that evaluates current agents that have completed or are currently in clinical trials for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia as a primary outcome. We highlight novel agents from miscellaneous drug classes, such as dextromethorphan/quinidine, bupropion/dextromethorphan, lumateperone, deudextromethorphan/quinidine, methylphenidate and scyllo-inositol, and drugs from various therapeutic classes (including atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and cannabinoids) that have demonstrated promising results and were generally well tolerated. Future research with large appropriately powered studies using validated outcome measures for behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia should be conducted to further establish the clinical utility of these agents.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia are highly prevalent and are associated with an increased risk of institutionalization and mortality. Current pharmacological treatments for these symptoms include cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. When used for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia, they are associated with limited efficacy and/or serious adverse events. As such, there has been extensive research into novel agents with varying mechanisms of action targeting behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia. In this article, we present the results of a comprehensive literature search and review that evaluates current agents that have completed or are currently in clinical trials for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia as a primary outcome. We highlight novel agents from miscellaneous drug classes, such as dextromethorphan/quinidine, bupropion/dextromethorphan, lumateperone, deudextromethorphan/quinidine, methylphenidate and scyllo-inositol, and drugs from various therapeutic classes (including atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and cannabinoids) that have demonstrated promising results and were generally well tolerated.

					<td class="ab">Youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have difficulties with compliance, impulsivity, and attention, which can affect daily adaptive functioning leading to disruptions in family social interactions, communication skills, academic achievement, and engagement in the community. Although previous research has identified behavioral treatments such as applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy for youth with ASD, it is important to explore more interventions that can be effective in decreasing problematic behaviors while also building positive social skill development. This case study illustrates the effectiveness of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) to address behavioral problems in a 7-year-old boy with high-functioning ASD (HF-ASD) and comorbid ADHD. Overall, the results demonstrated a decrease in child challenging behaviors and an increase in child compliance. In addition, the child&#039;s mother increased her use of positive parenting skills and effective commands. This study provides additional support for PCIT for children with ASD, but was not without challenges. These challenges, characteristic of families affected by ASD, and treatment implications for clinicians working with this population are discussed.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have difficulties with compliance, impulsivity, and attention, which can affect daily adaptive functioning leading to disruptions in family social interactions, communication skills, academic achievement, and engagement in the community. Although previous research has identified behavioral treatments such as applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy for youth with ASD, it is important to explore more interventions that can be effective in decreasing problematic behaviors while also building positive social skill development. This case study illustrates the effectiveness of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) to address behavioral problems in a 7-year-old boy with high-functioning ASD (HF-ASD) and comorbid ADHD. Overall, the results demonstrated a decrease in child challenging behaviors and an increase in child compliance. In addition, the child&#039;s mother increased her use of positive parenting skills and effective commands. This study provides additional support for PCIT for children with ASD, but was not without challenges. These challenges, characteristic of families affected by ASD, and treatment implications for clinicians working with this population are discussed.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.</span><span>A Case Study of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy for the Treatment of High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder</span><span>metadate</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Importance: Evidence on the titration of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is lacking. However, this lack of evidence has not prevented medication guidelines from specifying apparently arbitrary dose limitations, which could discourage clinicians from titrating methylphenidate to higher and, perhaps for some patients, more efficacious doses. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Objective(s): To determine the evidence on dose titration and adverse events associated with dose titration of stimulants for ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Data Sources: MEDLINE from 1946, Embase from 1974, and PsycINFO from 1806 through April 1, 2019, were searched to identify relevant articles. Study Selection: The inclusion criteria were that (1) the study was conducted on children up to 18 years of age; (2) children had a diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or hyperkinetic disorder according to the International Classification of Diseases codes; and (3) the dose of methylphenidate was determined by titration. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity were followed. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Jadad scoring system. Statistical analysis was undertaken using a random-effects model. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes of interest were (1) the doses used in published clinical trials, (2) the clinical justification given by researchers for their selected dose range, and (3) the adverse effects associated with methylphenidate when the dose is established by titration. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): A total of 11 randomized clinical trials and 38 cohort studies were analyzed. The randomized clinical trials involved 1304 participants treated with methylphenidate and 887 controls; the 38 cohort studies included 5524 participants. Maximum doses of methylphenidate ranged from 0.8 to 1.8 mg/kg/d. Some studies detailed their method of titration, including starting dose, titration interval, increment dose, and maximum dose. Not all of these studies reported justification for the chosen dose range. Common adverse effects of methylphenidate included insomnia (odds ratio, 4.66; 95% CI, 1.99-10.92; P &lt;.001), anorexia (5.11 higher than for those who took placebo; 95% CI, 1.99-13.14; P &lt;.001), abdominal pain (1.9 times more likely; 95% CI, 0.77-4.77; P =.16), and headache (14% of participants; 95% CI, 10%-20%; P &lt;.001). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusions and Relevance: A range of maximum doses for methylphenidate was recommended in clinical studies; no discernable scientific justification for any particular dose was given. Reports of life-threatening adverse events were absent; further studies of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of methylphenidate titrated purely on clinical grounds, without reference to any set maximum dose, are needed..&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 American Medical Association.

					<td class="ab">Purpose: To date, studies that linked dry eye disease (DED) to medication use were hypothesis-driven and did not investigate individual drugs. The purpose of this large study was to investigate the association between DED and both medication classes and individual drugs, using a hypothesis-free approach. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): 79,866 participants (age range 20-97 yrs, 58% female) from the populationbased Lifelines cohort in the Netherlands were cross-sectionally assessed for dry eye using the WHS dry eye questionnaire. Frequency of dryness and irritation symptoms were both scored; 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often), or 3 (constantly) and a total of 2 or higher wasassigned as symptomatic DED. All medications used were coded with the ATC classification system. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex, was used to assess the risk of the 62 most used therapeutic/pharmacological subgroups (3rd level ATC) and the 100 most used individual drugs (5th level ATC) on symptomatic DED. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): A total of 38 (61%) medication subgroups and 52 (52%) individual drugs were associated with dry eye (P&lt;0.05). A multivariable model, including all medications that were univariably associated (P&lt;0.10), but excluding medications that are used to treat DED or diseases known to cause DED (e.g. artificial tears and antirheumatic drugs), revealed the highest risk of DED (see Table) for antiglaucoma drugs, drugs for functional gastrointestinal disorders, psychostimulants for ADHD, drugs for peptic ulcer, drugs for constipation and urologicals. Low-ceiling diuretics appeared protective of dry eye symptoms. Using a similar approach, individual drugs that showed the highest risk of DED were mebeverine, methylphenidate, pantoprazole, omeprazole, isphagula, and risedronic acid. Hydrochlorthiazide and the oral contraceptive desogestrel and ethinylestradiol were associated with fewer dry eye symptoms. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): This large hypothesis-free study found medication use to be highly associated with DED and underlines the importance for doctors to assess medication status in DED. We discovered several new associations, confirmed but also debunked suggested associations from smaller studies, and found novel medication class differences. These results are highly relevant for potential treatment options and prevention strategies in DED. (Table Presented) .</td>

					<td class="ab">Early studies of behavioral teratology were mostly descriptive, fulfilling the necessary first requirement in a new field. The next obvious stage was put forward in the 80&#039;s as mechanism driven science enabled reversal of the teratogens-induced deficits. Three decades later a plethora of studies have been published demonstrating the success of the new direction. Complete and long-term (ostensibly permanent) reversal has been demonstrated in numerous animal models representing the realization of the ultimate goal of the field. Perhaps less sought after, but still significant, are the studies on recovery which needs consistent treatment for its persistence The studies reviewed here have been summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Clinically, the field is only in its incipient stage because of the paucity in translational findings for complete reversal or even complete alleviation. Human findings are emerging but in partial alleviation, noteworthy were the demonstration of FASD children who showed improvement after choline treatment while others showed no effect. Consequently, while further studies in an animal model on the mechanism by which the teratogen exerts its deleterious effects and the reversal procedure action are important, the main thrust of the research should now be translation of the animal model findings into a standard clinical routine. Indeed, first steps towards these goals are being made in children with various neurodevelopmental disorders via the application of a variety of rehabilitation programs by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, but the results are partial and may not be long-lasting.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019</td>

					<td class="ab">The underlining mechanism in neural mitochondrial dysfunction and consequences neurotoxicity, and cognitive behavior after methylphenidate (MPH)prolonged uses is unclear and proposing of therapeutic approaches for treatment of these types of neurotoxicity is one of the main goals of scientist in this manner. MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in neural cells caused induction of oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and cognition impairment, which leads to neurotoxicity, was reported previously but role of key neural cells proteins and involved signaling pathway in this manner remained indeterminate. Tau protein aggregation is a biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegenerative event and cognition impairment. Tau aggregation occur by stimulation effects of Glycogen synthase kinase-3(GSK3beta)and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)which activates protein kinase B(Akt)and causes inhibition of phosphorylation(activation)of GSK3beta, thus Akt activation can cause inhibition of tau aggregation (hyper-phosphorylation). Management of mentioned MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and consequences of neurotoxicity, and cognitive behavior through a new generation neuroprotective combination, based on modulation of disturbed in Akt function and inhibition of GSK3beta and tau hyper-phosphorylation can be a prefect therapeutic interventions. Therefore, finding, introduction and development of new neuroprotective properties and explanation of their effects with potential capacity for modulation of tau hyper-phosphorylation via PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway is necessitated. During recent years, using new neuroprotective compounds with therapeutic probability for treatment of psychostimulant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious effects have been amazingly increased. Many previous studies have reported the neuroprotective roles of minocycline (a broad-spectrum and long-acting antibiotic)in multiple neurodegenerative events and diseases in animal model. But the role of neuroprotective effects of this agent against MPH induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious and also role of tau hyper-phosphorylation by modulation of PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway in this manner remain unknown. Thus we suggested and theorized that by using minocycline in MPH addicted subject, it would provide neuroprotection against MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious. Also we hypothesized that minocycline, via modulation of PI3/Akt/GSK and inhibition of tau hyper-phosphorylation, can inhibit MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious. In this article, we tried to discuss our hypothesis regarding the possible role of minocycline, as a powerful neuroprotective agent, and also role of tau hyper-phosphorylation related to PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway in treatment of MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive disturbance.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Ltd</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>The underlining mechanism in neural mitochondrial dysfunction and consequences neurotoxicity, and cognitive behavior after methylphenidate (MPH)prolonged uses is unclear and proposing of therapeutic approaches for treatment of these types of neurotoxicity is one of the main goals of scientist in this manner. MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in neural cells caused induction of oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and cognition impairment, which leads to neurotoxicity, was reported previously but role of key neural cells proteins and involved signaling pathway in this manner remained indeterminate. Tau protein aggregation is a biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegenerative event and cognition impairment. Tau aggregation occur by stimulation effects of Glycogen synthase kinase-3(GSK3beta)and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)which activates protein kinase B(Akt)and causes inhibition of phosphorylation(activation)of GSK3beta, thus Akt activation can cause inhibition of tau aggregation (hyper-phosphorylation). Management of mentioned MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and consequences of neurotoxicity, and cognitive behavior through a new generation neuroprotective combination, based on modulation of disturbed in Akt function and inhibition of GSK3beta and tau hyper-phosphorylation can be a prefect therapeutic interventions. Therefore, finding, introduction and development of new neuroprotective properties and explanation of their effects with potential capacity for modulation of tau hyper-phosphorylation via PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway is necessitated. During recent years, using new neuroprotective compounds with therapeutic probability for treatment of psychostimulant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious effects have been amazingly increased. Many previous studies have reported the neuroprotective roles of minocycline (a broad-spectrum and long-acting antibiotic)in multiple neurodegenerative events and diseases in animal model. But the role of neuroprotective effects of this agent against MPH induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious and also role of tau hyper-phosphorylation by modulation of PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway in this manner remain unknown. Thus we suggested and theorized that by using minocycline in MPH addicted subject, it would provide neuroprotection against MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious. Also we hypothesized that minocycline, via modulation of PI3/Akt/GSK and inhibition of tau hyper-phosphorylation, can inhibit MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive malicious. In this article, we tried to discuss our hypothesis regarding the possible role of minocycline, as a powerful neuroprotective agent, and also role of tau hyper-phosphorylation related to PI3/Akt/GSK signaling pathway in treatment of MPH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and cognitive disturbance.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Ltd</span><span>A hypothetic role of minocycline as a neuroprotective agent against methylphenidate-induced neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction and tau protein hyper-phosphorylation: Possible role of PI3/Akt/GSK3beta signaling pathway</span></td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Gait impairments are among the most common and disabling symptoms of Parkinson&#039;s disease. Nonetheless, gait is not routinely assessed quantitatively but is described in general terms that are not sensitive to changes ensuing with disease progression. Quantifying multiple gait features (eg, speed, variability, and asymmetry) under natural and more challenging conditions (eg, dual-tasking, turning, and daily living) enhanced sensitivity of gait quantification. Studies of neural connectivity and structural network topology have provided information on the mechanisms of gait impairment. Advances in the understanding of the multifactorial origins of gait changes in patients with Parkinson&#039;s disease promoted the development of new intervention strategies, such as neurostimulation and virtual reality, aimed at alleviating gait impairments and enhancing functional mobility. For clinical applicability, it is important to establish clear links between specific gait impairments, their underlying mechanisms, and disease progression to foster the acceptance and usability of quantitative gait measures as outcomes in future disease-modifying clinical trials.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Ltd</span><span>Gait impairments in Parkinson&#039;s disease</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Introduction: According to actual estimates, approximately five percent of children of school age suffer from hyperkinetic disorder/AD(H) S (Polanczyk et al., 2007; Banaschewski et al., 2017), so that innovative and effective treatment methods that show long-lasting efficacy without the use of psychotropic drugs are of great relevance. Compared to AD(H) S therapies with pharmacological substances such as methylphenidate, neurofeedback (NFB) can achieve similar effects (Fuchs et al., 2003; Monastra et al., 2002; Rossiter and La Vaque, 2004). A modern and evidence-based variant of this procedure is the so-called ILF neurofeedback, which differs from the &#034;classical&#034; NFB in the following points, among others: (1) In addition to the &#034;conventional&#034; EEG signals in the frequency range 1-40 Hz, brain activity is also processed in the so-called &#034;infra-low&#034; frequency range below 0.1 Hz. (2) To convert the measured ILF signals of the EEG into visual, auditory and tactile feedback signals, the therapist sets an individual coupling factor for each patient. (3) The EEG measurement is performed in a bipolar montage, where the placement of the electrodes on the skull is chosen according to the symptoms of over- or under arousal of the patient. Currently, there are only a few studies using ILF neurofeedback as a treatment for AD(H) S (Sasu and Othmer, 2015). The present study is therefore intended to clarify the question of whether ILF neurofeedback is an effective therapy for children and adolescents with AD(H) disorders. To evaluate the results, a continuous performance test (CPT) was performed before and after the ILF neurofeedback treatment for various parameters of attention and impulse control. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): In total, 251 patients in childhood and adolescence (7-21 years) with clinically validated diagnosis of AD(H) disorder participated in the data collection and received therapy in the form of 30 ILF neurofeedback treatments over a period of roughly 15 weeks, which corresponds to about two sessions per week. A continuous performance test (CPT) was performed by each participant of the study before (T0) and after (T1) NFB treatment to assess clinically relevant parameters of attention and impulse control. In addition, a symptom analysis and a Copeland symptom listing were performed at these times (Copeland, 1989). In this study only data were collected from 196 participants who were able to complete the complete NFB treatment and CPT tests as well as the pre- and post-operative examinations. All these interventions were carried out by specialist therapists who had qualified in a certified ILF neurofeedback training course lasting several days. To perform ILF neurofeedback EEG NeuroAmp amplifiers and Cygnet software (Corscience GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Erlangen) were used. The ILF neurofeedback treatment protocol applied corresponds to the Othmer method, which measures parameters of slow cortical potentials in the low frequency range (&lt;0.1 Hz) and processes them for the feedback process. The protocol also inhibits steep amplitude increases of EEG activity in certain bands of the entire frequency spectrum between 0-40 Hz (Othmer, 2017). This approach is evidence-based and is individually adapted to the patient. The EEG was recorded via sintered silver/silver chloride electrodes in a bipolar montage. The positioning of the electrodes was determined individually for each patient based on symptoms. The CPT was performed using the &#034;QIK-Test&#034; device (BEE Medic GmbH, Singen). Each test had a duration of 21-min, during which the patient had to press a button on the device to respond to each target signal and had not to press a button for each non-target signal that was displayed. During this GO/NOGO test, the device recorded various parameters of attention and impulsivity, such as the response time (RT), the average RT, the variability of the response time (VAR) as well as omission errors (OM) and commission errors (CO). Average RT is the mean of all correct reaction times to a target. VAR is the standard deviation of correct response times. OM occur when the subject does not respond correctly to a target CO occur when the subject responds incorrectly to a non-target. While omission errors (and outliners) are considered to determine sustained attention, commission errors (and anticipatory errors) are considered to determine impulse control. The data evaluation was carried out using &#034;Xlstat&#034;, a tool of the &#034;Excel&#034; software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Data from 196 participants whose average age was 12.1 years could be included in the study (SD: 2.8, interval: 7.3-21.5). The gender distribution was 21% female and 79% male. In the CPTs performed at times T0 and T1, changes in the following four variables of attention and impulse control were analyzed: average response time (RT), variability of response time (VAR), omission error (OM), and commission error (CO). The averaged RT of the patients improved during the 30 sessions of ILF-Neurofeedback by about 21 ms (from 457 ms (SD = 88 ms) at T0 to 436 ms (SD = 85 ms) at T1). In parallel, VAR improved too by about 18 ms (from 122 ms (SD = 30 ms) at T0 to 104 ms (SD = 30 ms) at T1). From the test parameters that determine impulse control, OM improved from an average of 9.6 errors (SD = 15.1 errors) at T0 to 5.0 errors (SD = 9.3 errors) at T1 and CO improved from an average of 19.1 errors (SD = 17.3 errors) at T0 to 9.0 errors (SD = 9.0 errors) at T1. The values of RT and VAR were compared using independent t-tests because a normal distribution with equal variances was given. Both variables showed statistically significant improvements (RT: t = 5.788, p &lt; 0.0001, two-tail; VAR: t = 13.7, p &lt; 0.0001, two-tail) after treatment of 30 sessions ILF neurofeedback. OM and CO did not follow a normal distribution, so a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed. In both variables there were statistically significant improvements in values (OM: Z = 83.5, p &lt; 0.0001; CO: Z = 90.5, p &lt; 0.0001) after ILF neurofeedback treatment. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Discussion(s): The &#034;QIK Test&#034; CPT is a computerized visual continuous performance test developed for assessing attention and impulse control. While omission errors (and outliners) are considered to determine sustained attention, commission errors (and anticipatory errors) are considered to determine impulse control. The analysis of the CPT data show a significant improvement of all parameters of sustained attention and impulse control after 30 sessions of ILF-Neurofeedback training. Although this study could not be substantiated by the addition of a control group, the results obtained suggest that ILF neurofeedback-assisted therapy in AD(H) S patients leads to a significant improvement in important parameters of attention and impulse control.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019</td>

					<td class="af"><span>Introduction: According to actual estimates, approximately five percent of children of school age suffer from hyperkinetic disorder/AD(H) S (Polanczyk et al., 2007; Banaschewski et al., 2017), so that innovative and effective treatment methods that show long-lasting efficacy without the use of psychotropic drugs are of great relevance. Compared to AD(H) S therapies with pharmacological substances such as methylphenidate, neurofeedback (NFB) can achieve similar effects (Fuchs et al., 2003; Monastra et al., 2002; Rossiter and La Vaque, 2004). A modern and evidence-based variant of this procedure is the so-called ILF neurofeedback, which differs from the &#034;classical&#034; NFB in the following points, among others: (1) In addition to the &#034;conventional&#034; EEG signals in the frequency range 1-40 Hz, brain activity is also processed in the so-called &#034;infra-low&#034; frequency range below 0.1 Hz. (2) To convert the measured ILF signals of the EEG into visual, auditory and tactile feedback signals, the therapist sets an individual coupling factor for each patient. (3) The EEG measurement is performed in a bipolar montage, where the placement of the electrodes on the skull is chosen according to the symptoms of over- or under arousal of the patient. Currently, there are only a few studies using ILF neurofeedback as a treatment for AD(H) S (Sasu and Othmer, 2015). The present study is therefore intended to clarify the question of whether ILF neurofeedback is an effective therapy for children and adolescents with AD(H) disorders. To evaluate the results, a continuous performance test (CPT) was performed before and after the ILF neurofeedback treatment for various parameters of attention and impulse control. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): In total, 251 patients in childhood and adolescence (7-21 years) with clinically validated diagnosis of AD(H) disorder participated in the data collection and received therapy in the form of 30 ILF neurofeedback treatments over a period of roughly 15 weeks, which corresponds to about two sessions per week. A continuous performance test (CPT) was performed by each participant of the study before (T0) and after (T1) NFB treatment to assess clinically relevant parameters of attention and impulse control. In addition, a symptom analysis and a Copeland symptom listing were performed at these times (Copeland, 1989). In this study only data were collected from 196 participants who were able to complete the complete NFB treatment and CPT tests as well as the pre- and post-operative examinations. All these interventions were carried out by specialist therapists who had qualified in a certified ILF neurofeedback training course lasting several days. To perform ILF neurofeedback EEG NeuroAmp amplifiers and Cygnet software (Corscience GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Erlangen) were used. The ILF neurofeedback treatment protocol applied corresponds to the Othmer method, which measures parameters of slow cortical potentials in the low frequency range (&lt;0.1 Hz) and processes them for the feedback process. The protocol also inhibits steep amplitude increases of EEG activity in certain bands of the entire frequency spectrum between 0-40 Hz (Othmer, 2017). This approach is evidence-based and is individually adapted to the patient. The EEG was recorded via sintered silver/silver chloride electrodes in a bipolar montage. The positioning of the electrodes was determined individually for each patient based on symptoms. The CPT was performed using the &#034;QIK-Test&#034; device (BEE Medic GmbH, Singen). Each test had a duration of 21-min, during which the patient had to press a button on the device to respond to each target signal and had not to press a button for each non-target signal that was displayed. During this GO/NOGO test, the device recorded various parameters of attention and impulsivity, such as the response time (RT), the average RT, the variability of the response time (VAR) as well as omission errors (OM) and commission errors (CO). Average RT is the mean of all correct reaction times to a target. VAR is the standard deviation of correct response times. OM occur when the subject does not respond correctly to a target CO occur when the subject responds incorrectly to a non-target.

During this GO/NOGO test, the device recorded various parameters of attention and impulsivity, such as the response time (RT), the average RT, the variability of the response time (VAR) as well as omission errors (OM) and commission errors (CO). Average RT is the mean of all correct reaction times to a target. VAR is the standard deviation of correct response times. OM occur when the subject does not respond correctly to a target CO occur when the subject responds incorrectly to a non-target. While omission errors (and outliners) are considered to determine sustained attention, commission errors (and anticipatory errors) are considered to determine impulse control. The data evaluation was carried out using &#034;Xlstat&#034;, a tool of the &#034;Excel&#034; software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Data from 196 participants whose average age was 12.1 years could be included in the study (SD: 2.8, interval: 7.3-21.5). The gender distribution was 21% female and 79% male. In the CPTs performed at times T0 and T1, changes in the following four variables of attention and impulse control were analyzed: average response time (RT), variability of response time (VAR), omission error (OM), and commission error (CO). The averaged RT of the patients improved during the 30 sessions of ILF-Neurofeedback by about 21 ms (from 457 ms (SD = 88 ms) at T0 to 436 ms (SD = 85 ms) at T1). In parallel, VAR improved too by about 18 ms (from 122 ms (SD = 30 ms) at T0 to 104 ms (SD = 30 ms) at T1). From the test parameters that determine impulse control, OM improved from an average of 9.6 errors (SD = 15.1 errors) at T0 to 5.0 errors (SD = 9.3 errors) at T1 and CO improved from an average of 19.1 errors (SD = 17.3 errors) at T0 to 9.0 errors (SD = 9.0 errors) at T1. The values of RT and VAR were compared using independent t-tests because a normal distribution with equal variances was given. Both variables showed statistically significant improvements (RT: t = 5.788, p &lt; 0.0001, two-tail; VAR: t = 13.7, p &lt; 0.0001, two-tail) after treatment of 30 sessions ILF neurofeedback. OM and CO did not follow a normal distribution, so a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed. In both variables there were statistically significant improvements in values (OM: Z = 83.5, p &lt; 0.0001; CO: Z = 90.5, p &lt; 0.0001) after ILF neurofeedback treatment. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Discussion(s): The &#034;QIK Test&#034; CPT is a computerized visual continuous performance test developed for assessing attention and impulse control. While omission errors (and outliners) are considered to determine sustained attention, commission errors (and anticipatory errors) are considered to determine impulse control. The analysis of the CPT data show a significant improvement of all parameters of sustained attention and impulse control after 30 sessions of ILF-Neurofeedback training. Although this study could not be substantiated by the addition of a control group, the results obtained suggest that ILF neurofeedback-assisted therapy in AD(H) S patients leads to a significant improvement in important parameters of attention and impulse control.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019</span><span>FV 9 Therapeutic effect of Infra-Low-Frequency (ILF-) Neurofeedback training on Children and Adolescents with Attention Deficit (Hyperkinetic) Disorder</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Pharmaceuticals which originally were designed to treat people with neurological and psychiatric conditions, e.g. Alzheimer&#039;s disease or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are nowadays often misused by students as a &#039;brain doping&#039; substances. These substances are known as nootropic drugs, smart drugs or cognitive enhancers, as they increase memory, attention and concentration of healthy individuals. Since they are easily available illicitly, their consumption is observed to be growing. Currently, these pharmaceuticals started gaining researchers&#039; attention, especially since they have been recently detected in wastewater, surface water and even drinking water. This review summarises the current state of knowledge on nootropic drugs in terms of their population use trends and ethics, occurrence in the environment and detection techniques, toxicity and removal methods, in example of methylphenidate, modafinil and piracetam - three most popular nootropics. It points out that the main sources of knowledge on cognitive enhancers illicit use are often inconsistent questionnaires, which are not supported by wastewater analysis to become more veracious. Simultaneously, the studies concerning toxicity and removal methods of nootropic drugs are still limited and in many cases environmentally irrelevant. Although the prescription rules has been subjected to more strict control in developed countries, regulatory frameworks with regard to their ecosystem occurrence are still lacking and should be introduced. Moreover, the use of environmentally relevant concentrations in toxicity studies should be a standard, leading to proper ecotoxicity risk assessment. Based on this review, it is recommended to routinely monitor nootropics and their metabolites in waste- and surface waters.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Ltd</td>

					<td class="ab">Methylphenidate (MPH) is a first line treatment for ADHD and is also misused as a purported cognitive enhancer, yet its effects on brain function are still poorly understood. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showed that MPH altered cortico-striatal resting functional connectivity (RFC). Here we investigated the effects of MPH in thalamic connectivity since the thalamus modulates striato-cortical signaling. We hypothesized that MPH would increase thalamic connectivity and metabolism, and that this response would be blunted in cannabis abusers. For this purpose, we measured RFC in seven thalamic nuclei using fMRI and brain glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) and &lt;ovid:sup&gt;18&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in sixteen healthy controls and thirteen participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD) twice after placebo and after MPH (0.5 mg/kg, iv). MPH significantly increased thalamo-cerebellar connectivity and cerebellar metabolism to the same extent in both groups. Group comparisons revealed that in CUD compared to controls, metabolism in nucleus accumbens was lower for the placebo and MPH measures, that MPH-induced increases in thalamic metabolism were blunted, and that enhanced negative connectivity between thalamus and accumbens in CUD was normalized by MPH (reducing negative connectivity). Our findings identify the thalamus as a target of MPH, which increased its metabolism and connectivity. The reduced metabolism in nucleus accumbens and the disrupted thalamo-accumbens connectivity (enhanced negative connectivity) in CUD is consistent with impaired reactivity of the brain reward&#039;s circuit. MPH&#039;s normalization of thalamo-accumbens connectivity (reduced negative connectivity) brings forth its potential therapeutic value in CUD, which merits investigation.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.</td>

					<td class="ab">Riluzole is a glutamatergic modulator of particular interest in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study we evaluated the safety and tolerability of 5-week of adjunctive riluzole treatment (vs. 5-week of placebo, with 2-week washout period) targeting ASD-associated drug-refractory irritability in eight individuals age 12-25 years. All participants tolerated riluzole 200 mg per day, however there were no statistically significant findings for the overall treatment effect, the treatment effect by week within period of the study, or a cross-over effect across the periods of the study on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale or the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale. The results of this trial indicate that 5-week of riluzole treatment was well tolerated, but had no significant effect on the target symptoms.

					<td class="tw"><span>Riluzole is a glutamatergic modulator of particular interest in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study we evaluated the safety and tolerability of 5-week of adjunctive riluzole treatment (vs. 5-week of placebo, with 2-week washout period) targeting ASD-associated drug-refractory irritability in eight individuals age 12-25 years. All participants tolerated riluzole 200 mg per day, however there were no statistically significant findings for the overall treatment effect, the treatment effect by week within period of the study, or a cross-over effect across the periods of the study on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale or the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale. The results of this trial indicate that 5-week of riluzole treatment was well tolerated, but had no significant effect on the target symptoms.

					<td class="ab">Objective: To study the variables impacting on time from symptom onset to diagnosis in childhood narcolepsy, including presence of cataplexy, onset in infancy, administration of the H1N1 Pandemrix vaccine, and date of diagnosis following the H1N1 pandemic. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Design(s): A retrospective cohort study of 42 children seen in a single tertiary pediatric neurology center between 1996 and 2016. Key results: Onset of symptoms of narcolepsy occurred between infancy and 15 years, with 92.9% of children symptomatic by 13 years. Time from reported symptom onset to diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 11 years, with 51.3% diagnosed within 12 months of symptom onset. Those patients who were reportedly symptomatic from birth had a statistically significant increased time from reported symptom onset to diagnosis. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): The symptoms of childhood narcolepsy progress over time. The number of annual diagnoses in this center increased over the study period, but there is no evidence that the time from symptom onset to diagnosis is decreasing. Being reportedly symptomatic from the age of &lt;1 year is associated with an increased time to diagnosis. We recommend raising awareness of narcolepsy among medical students and general practitioners. It is important that clinicians appreciate the clinical relevance of excessive daytime sleepiness.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objective: To study the variables impacting on time from symptom onset to diagnosis in childhood narcolepsy, including presence of cataplexy, onset in infancy, administration of the H1N1 Pandemrix vaccine, and date of diagnosis following the H1N1 pandemic. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Design(s): A retrospective cohort study of 42 children seen in a single tertiary pediatric neurology center between 1996 and 2016. Key results: Onset of symptoms of narcolepsy occurred between infancy and 15 years, with 92.9% of children symptomatic by 13 years. Time from reported symptom onset to diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 11 years, with 51.3% diagnosed within 12 months of symptom onset. Those patients who were reportedly symptomatic from birth had a statistically significant increased time from reported symptom onset to diagnosis. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): The symptoms of childhood narcolepsy progress over time. The number of annual diagnoses in this center increased over the study period, but there is no evidence that the time from symptom onset to diagnosis is decreasing. Being reportedly symptomatic from the age of &lt;1 year is associated with an increased time to diagnosis. We recommend raising awareness of narcolepsy among medical students and general practitioners. It is important that clinicians appreciate the clinical relevance of excessive daytime sleepiness.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.</span><span>Factors Influencing Time to Diagnosis in Childhood Narcolepsy Type 1</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Many psychoactive substances affect the human dopamine (DA) reuptake transporter (hDAT). Polymorphisms in the encoding gene could affect the functionality of the transporter and consequently alter effects of psychotropic and recreational drugs. Recently, a T356 M single nucleotide polymorphism in the human SLC6A3 gene was described, which resulted in functional impairments of DA uptake. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 10 psychoactive substances (0.01-1000 muM)) on DA uptake in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transiently overexpressing wildtype (WT) or T356 M hDAT. Our data shows that T356 M hDAT has a 3 times lower V&lt;ovid:inf&gt;max&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; and a 3 times higher K&lt;ovid:inf&gt;m&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; compared to WT hDAT. Additionally, all psychoactive substances inhibited DA uptake by T356 M and WT hDAT. The DA reuptake inhibitors (methylphenidate, cocaine, and bupropion) inhibited DA uptake by WT hDAT most potently, followed by amphetamine-type stimulants [4-fluoroamphetamine (4-FA), amphetamine and MDMA], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; fluoxetine and citalopram) and arylcyclohexylamines [methoxetamine (MXE) and ketamine]. Compared to DA uptake by WT hDAT, bupropion, methylphenidate, cocaine, and MXE less potently inhibited DA uptake by T356 M hDAT, while citalopram more potently inhibited uptake. The differences in IC&lt;ovid:inf&gt;50&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; values between T356 M and WT hDAT were considerable (3-45 fold). As such, the presence of this polymorphism could affect treatment efficiency with these substances as well as susceptibly for toxicity and addiction for individuals carrying this polymorphism.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 The Author(s)</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Many psychoactive substances affect the human dopamine (DA) reuptake transporter (hDAT). Polymorphisms in the encoding gene could affect the functionality of the transporter and consequently alter effects of psychotropic and recreational drugs. Recently, a T356 M single nucleotide polymorphism in the human SLC6A3 gene was described, which resulted in functional impairments of DA uptake. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 10 psychoactive substances (0.01-1000 muM)) on DA uptake in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transiently overexpressing wildtype (WT) or T356 M hDAT. Our data shows that T356 M hDAT has a 3 times lower V&lt;ovid:inf&gt;max&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; and a 3 times higher K&lt;ovid:inf&gt;m&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; compared to WT hDAT. Additionally, all psychoactive substances inhibited DA uptake by T356 M and WT hDAT. The DA reuptake inhibitors (methylphenidate, cocaine, and bupropion) inhibited DA uptake by WT hDAT most potently, followed by amphetamine-type stimulants [4-fluoroamphetamine (4-FA), amphetamine and MDMA], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; fluoxetine and citalopram) and arylcyclohexylamines [methoxetamine (MXE) and ketamine]. Compared to DA uptake by WT hDAT, bupropion, methylphenidate, cocaine, and MXE less potently inhibited DA uptake by T356 M hDAT, while citalopram more potently inhibited uptake. The differences in IC&lt;ovid:inf&gt;50&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; values between T356 M and WT hDAT were considerable (3-45 fold). As such, the presence of this polymorphism could affect treatment efficiency with these substances as well as susceptibly for toxicity and addiction for individuals carrying this polymorphism.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 The Author(s)</span><span>Differential effects of psychoactive substances on human wildtype and polymorphic T356M dopamine transporters (DAT)</span><span>Lipo [Germany]</span><span>eurocept [Netherlands]</span><span>Perkin Elmer [Netherlands]</span><span>spruyt hillen [Netherlands]</span><span>Sigma Aldrich [United States]</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Objective: Off-label prescription is a common practice in psychiatry, raising health and economic concerns. Collegial consultation could allow a framed prescription of treatments that are not authorized in specific indications. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity in adult populations (ADHD) is a striking example of a pathology where off-label prescription is frequent. First considered to be a childhood disorder, the awareness of this condition in adults is increasing, leading to the development of new clinical practices and treatments. However, the adult ADHD diagnosis and its management are still emerging in France despite a high prevalence. Treatment of adult ADHD relies on methylphenidate prescription, but the initiation of this drug is not authorized in adult populations. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that is structurally close to amphetamine and acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Due to these pharmacological properties, neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular side-effects could occur. Furthermore, its addictive potential has led France to classify it as a psychoactive drug, dispensed via secured prescription.

Collegial consultation could allow a framed prescription of treatments that are not authorized in specific indications. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity in adult populations (ADHD) is a striking example of a pathology where off-label prescription is frequent. First considered to be a childhood disorder, the awareness of this condition in adults is increasing, leading to the development of new clinical practices and treatments. However, the adult ADHD diagnosis and its management are still emerging in France despite a high prevalence. Treatment of adult ADHD relies on methylphenidate prescription, but the initiation of this drug is not authorized in adult populations. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that is structurally close to amphetamine and acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Due to these pharmacological properties, neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular side-effects could occur. Furthermore, its addictive potential has led France to classify it as a psychoactive drug, dispensed via secured prescription. The first prescription and the one-year follow-up are restricted to neurologists, paediatrics, psychiatrists and sleep disorders specialists at hospital. The objective of this article is to propose a multidisciplinary framework for the off-label prescription of methylphenidate in adult ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): The Multidisciplinary Advice Consultation for Exceptional Addiction Treatments (Consultation d&#039;Avis Multidisciplinaire de Traitements d&#039;Exception en Addictologie CAMTEA) was first set up in Lille for the prescription of baclofen in alcohol dependence and was then extended to topiramate in binge eating disorder.

					<td class="ab">Background: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are common comorbidities of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The most commonly prescribed medication for ADHD is methylphenidate. The clinical response to methylphenidate may be monitored against DSM-5 symptomatology, rating scales or interviews. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Aim(s): To evaluate the use of perceptual and cognitive processing speed measures to monitor methylphenidate effects in adults with ADHD and SUD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) monitored perceptual and cognitive processing speed in 28 adults with ADHD and SUD on treatment with methylphenidate before and after the morning dose. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Twenty-six patients responded on AQT after the morning dose of methylphenidate. One-way ANOVA indicated significant treatment effects for color, form, and color-form combination naming, but not for shift cost values. Before the morning dose of methylphenidate, 92% were identified by cutoff time criteria for longer-than-normal processing times. After the morning dose of methylphenidate, 65% obtained color and form measures in the normal range for age peers. Only 35% obtained color-form processing measures in the normal range. Inter-individual response variability before medication intake was considerably larger than previously reported in studies of adults with ADHD only. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Proportionally, fewer adults with ADHD and SUD exhibited normalization of processing speed than previously observed for adults with ADHD without SUD. A potential clinical implication of the present study is that the AQT test may be used as a tool for dose-adjustment of central stimulants in the treatment of adults with ADHD and SUD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, &amp;#xa9; 2019 The Author(s).

The chapter illustrates the data triangulation approach by the use of clinical examples and aims to consider mechanism of action data in conjunction with clinical features to provide an overarching understanding of the clinical presentation.

					<td class="tw"><span>This chapter begins by considering why it is important to understand the clinical patterns of acute toxicity associated with new psychoactive substances (NPS), the challenges associated with gathering these data, the sources of information available and the limitations of each. It describes the data triangulation approach that can be used to combine individual, each inherently limited, data sources to help build the picture of the pattern of acute non-fatal toxicity associated with NPS. The chapter illustrates the data triangulation approach by the use of clinical examples and aims to consider mechanism of action data in conjunction with clinical features to provide an overarching understanding of the clinical presentation. Examples of the most important individual and groups of NPS were identified using multimodal literature searching based on the most relevant terms. The chapter provides descriptive accounts that are a complete reference source on the patterns of acute toxicity.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.</span><span>Patterns of acute toxicity associated with new psychoactive substances</span></td>

					<td class="ab">The phenomenon of new psychoactive substances (NPS), which came to the attention of the wider international community at the beginning of the 2010s, has been unprecedented in terms of the sheer number of substances, their rate of emergence, chemical diversity, and range of pharmacological effects. In particular, the chemical diversity has been a challenge to promoting a better understanding of the NPS market - a fundamental requirement for effective policy decisions and interventions. This manuscript highlights the significant chemical diversity of NPS and describes an alternative, complementary, and pragmatic classification based on pharmacological effects, which aligns NPS to traditional controlled drugs and enhances understanding of the phenomenon. It further reviews actions taken at the international level to address the NPS issue, including changes in the scope of control of some NPS and the enhancement of the United Nations Early Warning Advisory on NPS to deal with the dynamics and evolution of the market.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>The phenomenon of new psychoactive substances (NPS), which came to the attention of the wider international community at the beginning of the 2010s, has been unprecedented in terms of the sheer number of substances, their rate of emergence, chemical diversity, and range of pharmacological effects. In particular, the chemical diversity has been a challenge to promoting a better understanding of the NPS market - a fundamental requirement for effective policy decisions and interventions. This manuscript highlights the significant chemical diversity of NPS and describes an alternative, complementary, and pragmatic classification based on pharmacological effects, which aligns NPS to traditional controlled drugs and enhances understanding of the phenomenon. It further reviews actions taken at the international level to address the NPS issue, including changes in the scope of control of some NPS and the enhancement of the United Nations Early Warning Advisory on NPS to deal with the dynamics and evolution of the market.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.</span><span>Emergence, diversity, and control of new psychoactive substances: A global perspective</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Objectives: Although second generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SG-LAIAs) have been approved and are widely used in adults, there is limited evidence for the use of long-acting formulations in children and adolescents. Thus, we systematically describe the off-label use of SG-LAIAs in clinical practice in adolescent inpatients. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): All individuals admitted to our Children and Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatry Unit receiving treatment with SG-LAIAs between January 2013 and June 2016 were reviewed. A retrospective analysis of medical records was conducted. Clinical diagnoses were established using DSM-5 criteria. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Thirty individuals (53.3% female) out of a total of 1,148 admitted patients (2.6%) were identified. The mean age was 16.3 (SD = 1.3; range: 12.5-17.9).The main diagnoses were psychosis (70%) and disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) (30%), although comorbidity was frequent (96.6%), especially drug use (55.2%, mostly cannabis). SG-LAIAs used were aripiprazole (40%), risperidone (36.7%), and paliperidone palmitate (23.3%), and the main reasons were a history of low compliance (90%) and/or poor insight (73.3%). A mean improvement of 31.7 (SD = 8.7) between admission and discharge was registered in the Children&#039;s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS); no differences were observed between different SG-LAIAs. Although they were generally well tolerated, 23.3% of patients reported mild short-term side effects, which were more frequent with risperidone than with aripiprazole (p = .014). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our clinical experience suggests that SG-LAIAs may be a safe treatment option during adolescence in inpatients with psychotic disorders, as well as with DBD. No differences were found in CGAS improvement scores between the three SGA-LAIAs used, although patients on risperidone reported more side effects than those on aripiprazole. Further research is needed so as to evaluate safety and effectiveness of SG-LAIAs in this population.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objectives: Although second generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SG-LAIAs) have been approved and are widely used in adults, there is limited evidence for the use of long-acting formulations in children and adolescents. Thus, we systematically describe the off-label use of SG-LAIAs in clinical practice in adolescent inpatients. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): All individuals admitted to our Children and Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatry Unit receiving treatment with SG-LAIAs between January 2013 and June 2016 were reviewed. A retrospective analysis of medical records was conducted. Clinical diagnoses were established using DSM-5 criteria. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Thirty individuals (53.3% female) out of a total of 1,148 admitted patients (2.6%) were identified. The mean age was 16.3 (SD = 1.3; range: 12.5-17.9).The main diagnoses were psychosis (70%) and disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) (30%), although comorbidity was frequent (96.6%), especially drug use (55.2%, mostly cannabis). SG-LAIAs used were aripiprazole (40%), risperidone (36.7%), and paliperidone palmitate (23.3%), and the main reasons were a history of low compliance (90%) and/or poor insight (73.3%). A mean improvement of 31.7 (SD = 8.7) between admission and discharge was registered in the Children&#039;s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS); no differences were observed between different SG-LAIAs. Although they were generally well tolerated, 23.3% of patients reported mild short-term side effects, which were more frequent with risperidone than with aripiprazole (p = .014). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our clinical experience suggests that SG-LAIAs may be a safe treatment option during adolescence in inpatients with psychotic disorders, as well as with DBD. No differences were found in CGAS improvement scores between the three SGA-LAIAs used, although patients on risperidone reported more side effects than those on aripiprazole. Further research is needed so as to evaluate safety and effectiveness of SG-LAIAs in this population.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.</span><span>Long-Acting Injectable Atypical Antipsychotic Use in Adolescents: An Observational Study</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Purpose of review When describing clinical or experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), the adjectives &#039;mild,&#039; &#039;moderate&#039; and &#039;severe&#039; are misleading. &#039;Mild&#039; clinical TBI frequently results in long-term disability. &#039;Severe&#039; rodent TBI actually resembles mild or complicated mild clinical TBI. Recent findings Many mild TBI patients appear to have recovered completely but have postconcussive symptoms, deficits in cognitive and executive function and reduced cerebral blood flow. After moderate TBI, 31.8% of patients died or were discharged to skilled nursing or hospice. Among survivors of moderate and severe TBI, 44% were unable to return to work. On MRI, 88% of mild TBI patients have evidence of white matter damage, based on measurements of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity/apparent diffusion coefficient. After sports concussion, clinically recovered patients have abnormalities in functional connectivity on functional MRI. Methylphenidate improved fatigue and cognitive impairment and, combined with cognitive rehabilitation, improved memory and executive functioning. In comparison to clinical TB, because the entire spectrum of experimental rodent TBI, although defined as moderate or severe, more closely resembles mild or complicated mild clinical TBI. Summary Many patients after mild or moderate TBI suffer long-term sequelae and should be considered a major target for translational research. Treatments that improve outcome in rodent TBI, even when the experimental injuries are defined as severe, might be most applicable to mild or moderate TBI.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.</td>

Recent findings Many mild TBI patients appear to have recovered completely but have postconcussive symptoms, deficits in cognitive and executive function and reduced cerebral blood flow. After moderate TBI, 31.8% of patients died or were discharged to skilled nursing or hospice. Among survivors of moderate and severe TBI, 44% were unable to return to work. On MRI, 88% of mild TBI patients have evidence of white matter damage, based on measurements of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity/apparent diffusion coefficient. After sports concussion, clinically recovered patients have abnormalities in functional connectivity on functional MRI. Methylphenidate improved fatigue and cognitive impairment and, combined with cognitive rehabilitation, improved memory and executive functioning.

					<td class="ab">Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was used to study the effects of cocaine versus methylphenidate administration on both the localization and abundance of lipids in Drosophila melanogaster brain. A J105 ToF-SIMS with a 40 keV gas cluster primary ion source enabled us to probe molecular ions of biomolecules on the fly with a spatial resolution of ~3 mum, giving us unique insights into the effect of these drugs on molecular lipids in the nervous system. Significant changes in phospholipid composition were observed in the central brain for both. Principal components image analysis revealed that changes occurred mainly for phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylinositols. When the lipid changes caused by cocaine were compared with those induced by methylphenidate, it was shown that these drugs exert opposite effects on the brain lipid structure.

					<td class="tw"><span>Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was used to study the effects of cocaine versus methylphenidate administration on both the localization and abundance of lipids in Drosophila melanogaster brain. A J105 ToF-SIMS with a 40 keV gas cluster primary ion source enabled us to probe molecular ions of biomolecules on the fly with a spatial resolution of ~3 mum, giving us unique insights into the effect of these drugs on molecular lipids in the nervous system. Significant changes in phospholipid composition were observed in the central brain for both. Principal components image analysis revealed that changes occurred mainly for phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylinositols. When the lipid changes caused by cocaine were compared with those induced by methylphenidate, it was shown that these drugs exert opposite effects on the brain lipid structure. We speculate that this might relate to the molecular mechanism of cognition and memory.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 American Chemical Society.</span><span>Mass Spectrometry Imaging Shows Cocaine and Methylphenidate Have Opposite Effects on Major Lipids in Drosophila Brain</span><span>Sigma Aldrich [Germany]</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Methylphenidate (MPH) is the classic treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children and adults. Despite its beneficial effects, non-medical use of MPH is nowadays a problem with high impact on society. Thus, our goal was to uncover the neurovascular and cognitive effects of MPH chronic use during a critical period of development in control conditions. For that, male Wistar Kyoto rats were treated with MPH (1.5 or 5 mg/kg/day at weekdays, per os) from P28 to P55. We concluded that the higher dose of MPH caused hippocampal blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability by vesicular transport (transcytosis) concomitantly with the presence of peripheral immune cells in the brain parenchyma. These observations were confirmed by in vitro studies, in which the knockdown of caveolin-1 in human brain endothelial cells prevented the increased permeability and leukocytes transmigration triggered by MPH (100 micro&amp;#32;M, 24 h). Furthermore, MPH led to astrocytic atrophy and to a decrease in the levels of several synaptic proteins and impairment of AKT/CREB signaling, together with working memory deficit assessed in the Y-maze test. On the contrary, we verified that the lower dose of MPH (1.5 mg/kg/day) increased astrocytic processes and upregulated several neuronal proteins as well as signaling pathways involved in synaptic plasticity culminating in working memory improvement. In conclusion, the present study reveals that a lower dose of MPH in normal rats improves memory performance being associated with the modulation of astrocytic morphology and synaptic machinery. However, a higher dose of MPH leads to BBB dysfunction and memory impairment.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Methylphenidate (MPH) is the classic treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children and adults. Despite its beneficial effects, non-medical use of MPH is nowadays a problem with high impact on society. Thus, our goal was to uncover the neurovascular and cognitive effects of MPH chronic use during a critical period of development in control conditions. For that, male Wistar Kyoto rats were treated with MPH (1.5 or 5 mg/kg/day at weekdays, per os) from P28 to P55. We concluded that the higher dose of MPH caused hippocampal blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability by vesicular transport (transcytosis) concomitantly with the presence of peripheral immune cells in the brain parenchyma. These observations were confirmed by in vitro studies, in which the knockdown of caveolin-1 in human brain endothelial cells prevented the increased permeability and leukocytes transmigration triggered by MPH (100 micro&amp;#32;M, 24 h). Furthermore, MPH led to astrocytic atrophy and to a decrease in the levels of several synaptic proteins and impairment of AKT/CREB signaling, together with working memory deficit assessed in the Y-maze test. On the contrary, we verified that the lower dose of MPH (1.5 mg/kg/day) increased astrocytic processes and upregulated several neuronal proteins as well as signaling pathways involved in synaptic plasticity culminating in working memory improvement. In conclusion, the present study reveals that a lower dose of MPH in normal rats improves memory performance being associated with the modulation of astrocytic morphology and synaptic machinery. However, a higher dose of MPH leads to BBB dysfunction and memory impairment.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018</span><span>Effect of chronic methylphenidate treatment on hippocampal neurovascular unit and memory performance in late adolescent rats</span></td>

					<td class="ab">This chapter begins with a brief review of descriptions and definitions of mystical-type experiences and the historical connection between classic hallucinogens and mystical experiences. The chapter then explores the empirical literature on experiences with classic hallucinogens in which claims about mystical or religious experiences have been made. A psychometrically validated questionnaire is described for the reliable measurement of mystical-type experiences occasioned by classic hallucinogens. Controlled laboratory studies show that under double-blind conditions that provide significant controls for expectancy bias, psilocybin can occasion complete mystical experiences in the majority of people studied. These effects are dose-dependent, specific to psilocybin compared to placebo or a psychoactive control substance, and have enduring impact on the moods, attitudes, and behaviors of participants as assessed by self-report of participants and ratings by community observers. Other studies suggest that enduring personal meaning in healthy volunteers and therapeutic outcomes in patients, including reduction and cessation of substance abuse behaviors and reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, are related to the occurrence of mystical experiences during drug sessions. The final sections of the chapter draw parallels in human neuroscience research between the neural bases of experiences with classic hallucinogens and the neural bases of meditative practices for which claims of mystical-type experience are sometimes made. From these parallels, a functional neural model of mystical experience is proposed, based on changes in the default mode network of the brain that have been observed after the administration of classic hallucinogens and during meditation practices for which mystical-type claims have been made.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>This chapter begins with a brief review of descriptions and definitions of mystical-type experiences and the historical connection between classic hallucinogens and mystical experiences. The chapter then explores the empirical literature on experiences with classic hallucinogens in which claims about mystical or religious experiences have been made. A psychometrically validated questionnaire is described for the reliable measurement of mystical-type experiences occasioned by classic hallucinogens. Controlled laboratory studies show that under double-blind conditions that provide significant controls for expectancy bias, psilocybin can occasion complete mystical experiences in the majority of people studied. These effects are dose-dependent, specific to psilocybin compared to placebo or a psychoactive control substance, and have enduring impact on the moods, attitudes, and behaviors of participants as assessed by self-report of participants and ratings by community observers. Other studies suggest that enduring personal meaning in healthy volunteers and therapeutic outcomes in patients, including reduction and cessation of substance abuse behaviors and reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, are related to the occurrence of mystical experiences during drug sessions. The final sections of the chapter draw parallels in human neuroscience research between the neural bases of experiences with classic hallucinogens and the neural bases of meditative practices for which claims of mystical-type experience are sometimes made. From these parallels, a functional neural model of mystical experience is proposed, based on changes in the default mode network of the brain that have been observed after the administration of classic hallucinogens and during meditation practices for which mystical-type claims have been made.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.</span><span>Classic hallucinogens and mystical experiences: Phenomenology and neural correlates</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background: When psychiatric symptoms are the leading or sole symptom in a neurologic disease, specific treatment may be lacking because therapy is only based on psychiatric guidelines. For Huntington&#039;s disease (HD) patients, who present initially with only psychiatric symptoms appropriate treatment is often not started until final diagnosis is made. Case Reports: Patient 1: First appointment at our Huntington Center NRW at the age of 13 years. Beginning at elementary school, he showed symptoms of ADHS, progressing to oppositional defiant and disruptive disorder with assault and theft. An inpatient stay for diagnostic investigation on a pediatric psychiatric ward was demanded by child protective/social services. Typical medication with the above-named behavioral symptoms such as methylphenidate and risperidone, respectively, as well as educational measures did not show the desired influence on the overall situation. Court threatened an involuntary commitment. Family history shows a multiple maternal HD burden, which was known but initially not associated with psychiatric symptoms and later not followed through. On top it was repressed by the family. During the outpatient visit, the patient did not only show the psychiatric symptoms but also a mild tremor, a mild dysmetria, and signs of dementia. Analysis of the huntingtin gene showed a repeat of 63 CAG triplets. We started with zuclopenthixol concomitant to risperidone which stabilized the situation to the extent that an involuntary commitment is not further necessary. The HD diagnosis eased the burden for the family, therapists, and teachers. Patient 2: The patient was deferred to us with a severe depression at the age of 16 years. Her mother was diagnosed with HD and had died since. From birth the patient lived with foster parents. Beginning at school age, she showed signs of ADHS and as an adolescent, a dysfunction of fine motor skills. At the age of 15 years, she became severely depressed and was treated on a pediatric psychiatric ward for a year. She continuously expressed suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide. SSRI and other antidepressants were tried as well as psychotherapy without improvement. She showed increasing lack of impulse control. During the outpatient visit, the patient showed a mild bradykinesia. Huntingtin gene analysis showed an increase of triplet repeat to 47. Clozapine, low-dose risperidone, and initially methylphenidate improved the situation. As of now, the patients have lived in an institution stable and independently for 3 years. The HD diagnosis has eased the burden in regard to school and future plans. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): HD may start with psychiatric symptoms, namely, with behavioral salience and/or a nonclassical AD(H)S. A positive family history for HD is the determining anamnestic clue. For underage patients, genetic analysis is only permitted for diagnostic purposes. That is why sometimes with allegedly solely psychiatric symptoms, one has to actively search for neurologic symptoms. The genetically confirmed diagnosis of an HD during childhood and adolescence relieves and allows for more specific therapy in line with recommendations for HD patients. This leads in general to an improved social situation for the patient and his family.</td>

On top it was repressed by the family. During the outpatient visit, the patient did not only show the psychiatric symptoms but also a mild tremor, a mild dysmetria, and signs of dementia. Analysis of the huntingtin gene showed a repeat of 63 CAG triplets. We started with zuclopenthixol concomitant to risperidone which stabilized the situation to the extent that an involuntary commitment is not further necessary. The HD diagnosis eased the burden for the family, therapists, and teachers. Patient 2: The patient was deferred to us with a severe depression at the age of 16 years. Her mother was diagnosed with HD and had died since. From birth the patient lived with foster parents. Beginning at school age, she showed signs of ADHS and as an adolescent, a dysfunction of fine motor skills. At the age of 15 years, she became severely depressed and was treated on a pediatric psychiatric ward for a year. She continuously expressed suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide. SSRI and other antidepressants were tried as well as psychotherapy without improvement. She showed increasing lack of impulse control. During the outpatient visit, the patient showed a mild bradykinesia. Huntingtin gene analysis showed an increase of triplet repeat to 47. Clozapine, low-dose risperidone, and initially methylphenidate improved the situation. As of now, the patients have lived in an institution stable and independently for 3 years. The HD diagnosis has eased the burden in regard to school and future plans. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): HD may start with psychiatric symptoms, namely, with behavioral salience and/or a nonclassical AD(H)S. A positive family history for HD is the determining anamnestic clue. For underage patients, genetic analysis is only permitted for diagnostic purposes. That is why sometimes with allegedly solely psychiatric symptoms, one has to actively search for neurologic symptoms. The genetically confirmed diagnosis of an HD during childhood and adolescence relieves and allows for more specific therapy in line with recommendations for HD patients. This leads in general to an improved social situation for the patient and his family.</span><span>Patients with juvenile Huntington&#039;s disease benefit from early diagnosis</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for binge eating disorder (BED); however, this treatment is underutilized, highlighting the need for additional treatment alternatives. Dopamine neurotransmission has been associated with dysregulated eating, and pharmaceutical agents targeting the dopamine system are associated with decreased binge eating and weight. The primary objective of the current investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of psychostimulant medication versus current best practices in the treatment of BED symptoms, in a randomized trial of methylphenidate versus CBT for BED. The secondary objective was to evaluate the ability of impulsivity to predict treatment outcomes. Female outpatients with BED were randomized to receive methylphenidate (n = 22) or CBT (n = 27) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was objective binge episode frequency; secondary outcomes included subjective binge episode frequency, body mass index (BMI), BED symptoms, and quality of life. Results showed that both treatments had a significant impact on primary and secondary outcomes. Methylphenidate and CBT were associated with decreases in subjective and objective binge episodes; methylphenidate was associated with greater decreases in BMI. Two impulsivity traits predicted clinical outcomes. Results provide preliminary support for the therapeutic benefit of methylphenidate in BED treatment, and prognostic utility of impulsivity in this context.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier B.V.</td>

					<td class="ab">Effectiveness and side-effect profile data on pharmacotherapy for daytime sleepiness in central hypersomnias are based largely upon randomized controlled trials. Evidence regarding the use of combination therapy is scant. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness and occurrence of drug-related side effects of these drugs in routine clinical practice. Adult patients diagnosed with a central hypersomnia during a 54-month period at a tertiary sleep disorders centre were identified retrospectively. Side effects were recorded at every follow-up visit. A total of 126 patients, with 3275 patient-months of drug exposure, were categorized into narcolepsy type 1 (n = 70), narcolepsy type 2 (n = 47) and idiopathic hypersomnia (n = 9). Modafinil was the most common drug used as a first-line treatment (93%) and in combination therapy (70%).

					<td class="ab">The use of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications during pregnancy has increased in recent years. An earlier article in this column examined whether psychostimulant medications, used to treated ADHD and related disorders, increase the risk of major congenital malformations in pregnancies with first trimester exposure to these drugs. This article examines whether amphetamines, methylphenidate, and atomoxetine exposure during early and late pregnancy are associated with other adverse gestational outcomes. One large and 4 small studies provided data relevant to the inquiry. In unadjusted analyses, amphetamines and methylphenidate were associated with an increased risk of most of the adverse outcomes under study. However, in analyses adjusted for potential confounds, amphetamine exposure during early pregnancy was associated only with an increased risk of preeclampsia; otherwise, amphetamine and methylphenidate exposure was not associated with the risk of preeclampsia, placental abruption, small for gestational age, or preterm birth. Late gestational exposure to psychostimulants was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth but not with the other adverse outcomes. In sensitivity analyses, such as one that examined exposure during weeks 8-18 of gestation, amphetamines were associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, placental abruption, and preterm birth, and methylphenidate, with an increased risk of preeclampsia. For reasons explained in the text, it may be prudent to err on the side of caution, but in the worst case scenario, the number needed to harm is about 63 for amphetamines exposure and preeclampsia and larger (eg, &gt; 500, indicating less risk) for other adverse outcomes. Atomoxetine was not associated with any adverse gestational outcome, but it is not clear whether this is a true finding or a result of underpowered analyses. In conclusion, women need to weigh the benefits of the ADHD medication that they are using against potential gestational risks when deciding whether or not to continue treatment during pregnancy.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2018 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</td>

However, in analyses adjusted for potential confounds, amphetamine exposure during early pregnancy was associated only with an increased risk of preeclampsia; otherwise, amphetamine and methylphenidate exposure was not associated with the risk of preeclampsia, placental abruption, small for gestational age, or preterm birth. Late gestational exposure to psychostimulants was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth but not with the other adverse outcomes. In sensitivity analyses, such as one that examined exposure during weeks 8-18 of gestation, amphetamines were associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, placental abruption, and preterm birth, and methylphenidate, with an increased risk of preeclampsia. For reasons explained in the text, it may be prudent to err on the side of caution, but in the worst case scenario, the number needed to harm is about 63 for amphetamines exposure and preeclampsia and larger (eg, &gt; 500, indicating less risk) for other adverse outcomes. Atomoxetine was not associated with any adverse gestational outcome, but it is not clear whether this is a true finding or a result of underpowered analyses. In conclusion, women need to weigh the benefits of the ADHD medication that they are using against potential gestational risks when deciding whether or not to continue treatment during pregnancy.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2018 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</span><span>Adverse gestational outcomes associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication exposure during pregnancy</span></td>

					<td class="ab">The use of prescription psychostimulants during pregnancy has been increasing in recent years. One large and 3 small studies have recently examined the risk of major congenital malformations following the use of methylphenidate and amphetamines during the first trimester of pregnancy. The broad findings of these studies are that first trimester gestational exposure to methylphenidate or amphetamines is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations but the associations are no longer statistically significant after adjusting analyses for confounding variables; that first trimester exposure to amphetamines is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations; and that first trimester exposure to methylphenidate may increase the risk of cardiovascular malformations. A closer look at the data on the last-mentioned finding, however, suggests that the statistical significance of the finding is in doubt and that even if the finding is statistically significant, it is probably not clinically significant. Furthermore, all the findings emerged from observational studies that cannot exclude confounding by indication and other sources of confounding. A reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that there is no evidence, at present, to suggest that methylphenidate and amphetamines are teratogenic. Nevertheless, because absence of evidence of risk is not evidence of absence of risk, the benefits of continuing psychostimulant medication during pregnancy should be weighed against potential risks in an individualized and shared decision-making process.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; Copyright 2018 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</td>

					<td class="ab">Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequently seen neuropsychiatric disorders in childhood. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and the adverse effects of two FDA-approved agents, atomoxetine (ATX) and osmotic release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH), in the treatment of ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Material(s) and Method(s): This research was designed as a randomized, open label, prospective and follow-up study. The study was performed by 120 cases between ages 7-16 years who were diagnosed as ADHD for the first time and given prescription. The cases were divided into two by randomization. One group was given ATX (n=59) while the other was given OROS-MPH (n=61) were evaluated prospectively by clinical examination and Conner&#039;s Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scale-Teacher (CRS-T) at the 2&lt;ovid:sup&gt;nd&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;, 4&lt;ovid:sup&gt;th&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;, and 6&lt;ovid:sup&gt;th&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; months. Efficacy of treatment was regarded as a 40% reduction in CRS-T scores when compared to baseline values, and the adverse effects were questioned in every follow up visit. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): The efficacy was 55.7% in CRS-T hyperactivity score, 63.9% in the attention deficit score, and 55.7% in the behavior problems score in OROS-MPH group. Those values were 47.5%, 69.5% and 57.6% respectively in ATX group. Adverse effects were seen in 27.1% (n=16) of the patients in the ATX group, and in 31.1% (n=19) of the patients in the OROS-MPH group. Two groups were not found significantly different for the frequency of adverse effects as well as the efficacy of the medication, at the follow-up evaluations which were performed at 2&lt;ovid:sup&gt;nd&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;, 4&lt;ovid:sup&gt;th&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; and 6&lt;ovid:sup&gt;th&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; months. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): In this study, ATX and OROS-MPH were compared for their efficacy and adverse effects for the treatment of ADHD, and two agents were found similar for their efficacies and adverse effect profiles. ATX and OROSMPH have similar efficacies in the treatment of ADHD and adverse effect profiles are similar.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2015 by Turkiye Klinikleri.</td>

					<td class="ab">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability, particularly among the young and the elderly. Several therapeutic options have been investigated, including drug interventions or combina-tional therapies. Although many drugs have shown promising results in the preclinical stage, all have failed in large clinical trials. Targeting the dopamine system is a novel TBI approach that provides benefits to functional outcomes. TBI could damage the dopaminergic system. Alterations in dopamine levels can impact cellular dysfunction and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Experimental evidence suggests that dopamine should be considered a first-line treatment to protect cerebral autoregulation and promote cerebral outcomes in TBI. Furthermore, investigation of dopamine-related genetic factors in relation to injury severity could also be of great significance for promoting TBI treatment. Importantly, various clinical lines of evidence have indicated that many dopamine agonists are beneficial when administered following injury in TBI patients. However, side effects of dopamine treatment prevent their use in TBI treatment, and there is a need for ongoing large, prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with these medications by the use of standardized criteria and outcomes to fully understand their effectiveness in this patient group. Here, we review the roles of dopamine in TBI and discuss the role that dopaminergic therapies have in neuroprotective strategies.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Prior to HBOT, single motion emission compute tomographic begin imaging (SPECT) revealed areas of hypo-perfusion bilaterally in the orbitofrontal region, temporal lobes and right dorsolateral-frontal, as well the medial aspect of the left cerebellum. Following two sets of HBOT treatments (60 plus 40), over 6 months, there was improvement in perfusion to the left cerebellum as well as the right frontal lobe. This was paralleled by improvement in immediate cognitive tests and an increase in functional brain volume. A follow-up 18 months after HBOT showed sustained improvement in attention with no need for methylphenidate, as well as in math skills and writing.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.

					<td class="ab">Purpose: Methylphenidate (MPH), the first-line medication in children with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is associated with increased risk of sleep disorders. Melatonin has both hypnotic and chronobiotic properties that influence circadian rhythm sleep disorders. This study explores the effectiveness of melatonin in children with ADHD who developed sleep problems after starting MPH. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Patients and Methods: This study, based on a clinical database, included 74 children (69 males, mean age 11.6+/-2.2 years) naturalistically treated with MPH (mean dosage 33.5+/-13.5 mg/d). The severity of sleep disorder (sleep onset delay) was recorded at baseline and after a follow-up of at least 4 weeks using a seven-point Likert scale according to the Clinical Global Impression Severity score. Effectiveness of melatonin on sleep (mean dosage 1.85+/-0.84 mg/d) after 4 weeks was assessed using a seven-point Likert scale according to the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) score, and patients who scored 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) were considered responders. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Clinical severity of sleep disorders was 3.41+/-0.70 at the baseline and 2.13+/-1.05 after the follow-up (P,0.001). According to the CGI-I score, 45 patients (60.8%) responded to the treatment with melatonin. Gender and age (children younger and older than 12 years) did not affect the response to melatonin on sleep. Patients with or without comorbidities did not differ according to sleep response. Specific comorbidities with disruptive behavior disorders (oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder), affective (mood and anxiety) disorders and learning disabilities did not affect the efficacy of melatonin on sleep. Treatment was well tolerated, and no side effects related to melatonin were reported. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): In children with ADHD with sleep problems after receiving MPH treatment, melatonin may be an effective and safe treatment, irrespective of gender, age and comorbidities.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Masi et al.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Purpose: Methylphenidate (MPH), the first-line medication in children with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is associated with increased risk of sleep disorders. Melatonin has both hypnotic and chronobiotic properties that influence circadian rhythm sleep disorders. This study explores the effectiveness of melatonin in children with ADHD who developed sleep problems after starting MPH. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Patients and Methods: This study, based on a clinical database, included 74 children (69 males, mean age 11.6+/-2.2 years) naturalistically treated with MPH (mean dosage 33.5+/-13.5 mg/d). The severity of sleep disorder (sleep onset delay) was recorded at baseline and after a follow-up of at least 4 weeks using a seven-point Likert scale according to the Clinical Global Impression Severity score. Effectiveness of melatonin on sleep (mean dosage 1.85+/-0.84 mg/d) after 4 weeks was assessed using a seven-point Likert scale according to the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) score, and patients who scored 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) were considered responders. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Clinical severity of sleep disorders was 3.41+/-0.70 at the baseline and 2.13+/-1.05 after the follow-up (P,0.001). According to the CGI-I score, 45 patients (60.8%) responded to the treatment with melatonin. Gender and age (children younger and older than 12 years) did not affect the response to melatonin on sleep. Patients with or without comorbidities did not differ according to sleep response. Specific comorbidities with disruptive behavior disorders (oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder), affective (mood and anxiety) disorders and learning disabilities did not affect the efficacy of melatonin on sleep. Treatment was well tolerated, and no side effects related to melatonin were reported. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): In children with ADHD with sleep problems after receiving MPH treatment, melatonin may be an effective and safe treatment, irrespective of gender, age and comorbidities.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Masi et al.</span><span>Effects of melatonin in children with attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder with sleep disorders after methylphenidate treatment</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background: Carboxylesterases (CES) play a critical role in catalyzing hydrolysis of esters, amides, carbamates and thioesters, as well as bioconverting prodrugs and soft drugs. The unique tissue distribution of CES enzymes provides great opportunities to design prodrugs or soft drugs for tissue targeting. Marked species differences in CES tissue distribution and catalytic activity are particularly challenging in human translation. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Review and summarization of CES fundamentals and applications in drug discovery and development. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Human CES1 is one of the most highly expressed drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver, while human intestine only expresses CES2. CES enzymes have moderate to high inter-individual variability and exhibit low to no expression in the fetus, but increase substantially during the first few months of life. The CES genes are highly polymorphic and some CES genetic variants show significant influence on metabolism and clinical outcome of certain drugs. Monkeys appear to be more predictive of human pharmacokinetics for CES substrates than other species. Low risk of clinical drug-drug interaction is anticipated for CES, although they should not be overlooked, particularly interaction with alcohols. CES enzymes are moderately inducible through a number of transcription factors and can be repressed by inflammatory cytokines. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of CESs, in vitro - in vivo extrapolation of clearance is still in its infancy and further exploration is needed. In vitro and in vivo tools are continuously being developed to characterize CES substrates and inhibitors.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Carboxylesterases (CES) play a critical role in catalyzing hydrolysis of esters, amides, carbamates and thioesters, as well as bioconverting prodrugs and soft drugs. The unique tissue distribution of CES enzymes provides great opportunities to design prodrugs or soft drugs for tissue targeting. Marked species differences in CES tissue distribution and catalytic activity are particularly challenging in human translation. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Review and summarization of CES fundamentals and applications in drug discovery and development. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Human CES1 is one of the most highly expressed drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver, while human intestine only expresses CES2. CES enzymes have moderate to high inter-individual variability and exhibit low to no expression in the fetus, but increase substantially during the first few months of life. The CES genes are highly polymorphic and some CES genetic variants show significant influence on metabolism and clinical outcome of certain drugs. Monkeys appear to be more predictive of human pharmacokinetics for CES substrates than other species. Low risk of clinical drug-drug interaction is anticipated for CES, although they should not be overlooked, particularly interaction with alcohols. CES enzymes are moderately inducible through a number of transcription factors and can be repressed by inflammatory cytokines. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of CESs, in vitro - in vivo extrapolation of clearance is still in its infancy and further exploration is needed. In vitro and in vivo tools are continuously being developed to characterize CES substrates and inhibitors.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.</span><span>The impact of carboxylesterases in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Preclinical studies suggest that central endogenous signaling of the nine amino acid peptide, oxytocin (OT) is altered in drug and alcohol addiction. There are preliminary preclinical and clinical studies indicating that administration of OT reduces addiction related behaviors such as selfadministration, conditioned place preference and withdrawal symptoms. As such, OT may represent a novel treatment for alcohol and drug dependence. However, there are still many unanswered questions that limit further clinical development of this promising treatment, such as the brain penetrance of OT when given systemically via intranasal or intravenous routes. Another question relates to its mechanism of action to mediate processes related to addiction such as itsmodulation of DA signaling inmesocorticolimbic pathways. We have conducted a series of nonhuman primate studies to investigate the brain tissue penetrance of labelled OT administered intravenously and intranasally, measuring labelled and endogenous OT by mass spectrometry. Labelled OT was detected in several brain regions and regional differences in endogenous brain OT were detected. We have also measured endogenous and administered labelled OT in the CSF over a prolonged timecourse (2 h). We conducted an [11C] raclopride PET study in nonhuman primates to investigate the effect of peripherally administered oxytocin on methylphenidate-stimulated dopamine in the ventral striatum. Finally, we have conducted human brain post-mortem studies in patients with AUD as well as individuals with other psychiatric disorders (with and without substance and alcohol use disorder comorbidity) that indicate changes in the oxytocin system (peptide or receptor) in the patient cohorts, compared to matched controls.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objective: Stimulant medication and behavior therapy are efficacious for youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, research suggests that stimulants may start and/or worsen sleep problems for youth. Further, the impact of behavior therapy for ADHD on sleep is unknown. This study examined the frequency of sleep problems and effects of stimulant medication, behavior therapy, and their combination on sleep problems in youth with ADHD. This study also explored the influence of dimensional baseline ratings of ADHD symptom subtype and psychiatric comorbidity on sleep outcomes. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Participants were 576 children (aged 7-9 years) with ADHD-Combined type from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study that compared methylphenidate, behavior therapy, and their combination to community care. Before treatment, parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist used to derive a total sleep problems score. Parents also completed ratings of oppositionality and ADHD symptom severity, whereas youth completed ratings of depression and anxiety. These ratings were readministered after treatment. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): General linear mixed-effects models were used to assess change in total sleep problems across treatment. The combined group exhibited a statistically significant reduction in total sleep problems (z =-5.81, p &lt; 0.001). Reductions in total sleep problems in methylphenidate (z =-3.11, p = 0.05), behavior therapy (z =-2.99, p = 0.08), or community care (z =-1.59, p &gt; 0.99) did not reach statistical significance. Change in psychiatric symptoms did not significantly moderate change in total sleep problems by treatment assignment. Greater baseline oppositional defiant disorder severity predicted less reduction in total sleep problems, chi&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;(1) = 3.86, p &lt; 0.05. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Findings suggest that combination of methylphenidate and behavior therapy is efficacious for reducing parent-reported sleep problems in young children with ADHD-Combined type relative to community care. However, potential ameliorative effects of monotherapy treatments (i.e., methylphenidate, behavior therapy) should be examined. Future replication is needed to confirm findings.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.</span><span>Changes in sleep problems across attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder treatment: Findings from the multimodal treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder study</span></td>

At present, Sodium oxybate, modafinil, methylphenidate and other stimulants are recommended first-line therapies for narcolepsy but are difficult to obtain in China. One hundred forty-eight patients with narcolepsy were treated with antidepressants and administered the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) before and after treatment from August 2012 to August 2017.

There were significant differences in the mean sleep latency (MSL) and sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) in MWT and ESS scores, cataplexy and cataplexy-like episodes before and after treatment (p &lt; 0.01). Venlafaxine demonstrated significantly greater improvements in MSL in the MWT (p &lt; 0.01).

					<td class="tw"><span>Narcolepsy is a life-long neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. At present, Sodium oxybate, modafinil, methylphenidate and other stimulants are recommended first-line therapies for narcolepsy but are difficult to obtain in China. One hundred forty-eight patients with narcolepsy were treated with antidepressants and administered the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) before and after treatment from August 2012 to August 2017. The subjects were followed for 1-6 years after treatment. Improvement in sleepiness, cataplexy, cataplexy-like episodes, and antidepressant side effects were assessed. There were significant differences in the mean sleep latency (MSL) and sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) in MWT and ESS scores, cataplexy and cataplexy-like episodes before and after treatment (p &lt; 0.01). Venlafaxine demonstrated significantly greater improvements in MSL in the MWT (p &lt; 0.01). Early awakenings and dry mouth were the most common adverse effects.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Ltd</span><span>Antidepressants for the treatment of narcolepsy: A prospective study of 148 patients in northern China</span></td>

					<td class="ab">The aim of this study was to investigate structural changes in the brain stem of adolescents with narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, fragmented night-time sleep, and cataplexy. For this purpose, we used quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to obtain R1 and R2 relaxation rates, proton density, and myelin maps in adolescents with narcolepsy (n = 14) and healthy controls (n = 14). We also acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for brainstem connectivity analysis. We found a significantly lower R2 in the rostral reticular formation near the superior cerebellar peduncle in narcolepsy patients, family wise error corrected p = .010. Narcolepsy patients had a mean R2 value of 1.17 s&lt;ovid:sup&gt;-1&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; whereas healthy controls had a mean R2 of 1.31 s&lt;ovid:sup&gt;-1&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;, which was a large effect size with Cohen d = 4.14. We did not observe any significant differences in R1 relaxation, proton density, or myelin content. The sensitivity of R2 to metal ions in tissue and the transition metal ion chelating property of neuromelanin indicate that the R2 deviant area is one of the neuromelanin containing nuclei of the brain stem. The close proximity and its demonstrated involvement in sleep-maintenance, specifically through orexin projections from the hypothalamus regulating sleep stability, as well as the results from the connectivity analysis, suggest that the observed deviant area could be the locus coeruleus or other neuromelanin containing nuclei in the proximity of the superior cerebellar peduncle. Hypothetically, the R2 differences described in this paper could be due to lower levels of neuromelanin in this area of narcolepsy patients.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 The Authors</td>

					<td class="ab">Objective: The purpose of this open-label study was to examine the effects of long-acting methylphenidate (MPH) treatment on irritability and related emotional symptoms associated with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in youth with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): The sample included 22 medication-free male and female subjects (ages 9-15) who met criteria for both DMDD and ADHD. Participants underwent a 4-week trial of long-acting MPH treatment (Concerta&lt;ovid:sup&gt;&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;), with weekly dosing increases until a therapeutic dose was reached. Repeated measures t-tests were used to compare pre- and posttreatment ratings of primary and secondary measures. The primary outcome was self-report irritability. Secondary outcomes included parent and child ratings of emotional frequency, emotional lability, and negative affect (NA). Multiple regression was used to examine the impact baseline hyperactivity, age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, or comorbid diagnosis had on treatment outcomes. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Significant improvements (medium to large effect sizes) in child-rated irritability as well as parent and child ratings of emotional lability, NA, and anger were found. As anticipated, ADHD symptoms also improved. While a majority of the sample saw improvement in child-rated irritability (71%), symptoms worsened a small proportion (19%), and an even smaller portion experienced no change (10%). No demographics, psychiatric comorbidities, or severity of ADHD symptoms influenced treatment outcomes. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Study findings suggest that MPH treatment significantly improved mood and emotional symptoms associated with DMDD comorbid with ADHD. These findings, coupled with good tolerability in this open-label pilot study supports further research into the use of MPH as a first-line treatment for DMDD. Future work examining MPH treatment of youth with DMDD with and without comorbid ADHD is needed.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</td>

					<td class="ab">Objective: To examine whether sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptomatology moderates dose response to methylphenidate and whether the impact of SCT on medication response is distinct from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtype effects. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Stimulant-naive children with ADHD predominantly inattentive type (ADHD-I; n = 126) or ADHD combined type (ADHD-C; n = 45) aged 7-11 years were recruited from the community from September 2006 to June 2013 to participate in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 4-week crossover trial of long-acting methylphenidate. ADHD diagnosis and subtype were established according to DSM-IV criteria using a structured interview and teacher ADHD symptom ratings. SCT symptoms were assessed using a teacher-rated scale with 2 factors (Sluggish/Sleepy and Daydreamy). Primary outcomes included (1) categorization of children as methylphenidate responders, methylphenidate nonresponders, or placebo responders by 2 blinded physicians and (2) parent and teacher ratings of child behavior on the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scales while subjects were on treatment with placebo or 1 of 3 methylphenidate dosages (low, medium, high). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Increased SCT Sluggish/Sleepy factor scores were associated with being a methylphenidate nonresponder or placebo responder rather than a methylphenidate responder (P =.04). Sluggish/Sleepy factor scores were also linked to diminished methylphenidate dose response for parent-and teacher-rated inattention symptoms (Sluggish/Sleepy factor x dose P =.004). SCT Daydreamy symptoms and ADHD subtype (ADHD-I vs ADHD-C) were not associated with methylphenidate responder status and did not moderate methylphenidate dose response for inattention symptoms. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): SCT Sluggish/Sleepy symptoms, but not SCT Daydreamy symptoms or ADHD subtype, predicted methylphenidate nonresponse. This novel finding, if replicated, may have important implications for assessing SCT as part of ADHD care.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&amp;#xa9; 2018 Copyright Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</td>

					<td class="ab">Introduction: Non-adherence to efficacious pharmacotherapy is a major obstacle in the treatment of children suffering from attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Some hold the position that pharmacotherapy induces anxiety, and that this is one of the reasons for this non-adherence. Previous studies have pointed to the opposite, a moderating effect of methylphenidate (MPH) on state anxiety in patients with ADHD. This has been shown in continuous treatment in children, but not on a single dose. We hypothesized that a single dose might have a different effect. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Twenty children with ADHD were given single doses of MPH in a randomized, controlled, crossover, double blind study. State anxiety using The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a continuous performance test were assessed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): As a group, no change was detected in state anxiety with MPH or placebo. However, children who were given MPH during the first session as opposed to those who received placebo first, demonstrated deterioration in baseline state anxiety in the second session [t&lt;ovid:inf&gt;(2.485)&lt;/ovid:inf&gt;, p &lt; 0.05]. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our findings show a possible delayed anxiety-provoking effect of a single dose of MPH.

					<td class="tw"><span>Introduction: Non-adherence to efficacious pharmacotherapy is a major obstacle in the treatment of children suffering from attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Some hold the position that pharmacotherapy induces anxiety, and that this is one of the reasons for this non-adherence. Previous studies have pointed to the opposite, a moderating effect of methylphenidate (MPH) on state anxiety in patients with ADHD. This has been shown in continuous treatment in children, but not on a single dose. We hypothesized that a single dose might have a different effect. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Twenty children with ADHD were given single doses of MPH in a randomized, controlled, crossover, double blind study. State anxiety using The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a continuous performance test were assessed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): As a group, no change was detected in state anxiety with MPH or placebo. However, children who were given MPH during the first session as opposed to those who received placebo first, demonstrated deterioration in baseline state anxiety in the second session [t&lt;ovid:inf&gt;(2.485)&lt;/ovid:inf&gt;, p &lt; 0.05]. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Our findings show a possible delayed anxiety-provoking effect of a single dose of MPH. This may be relevant to the understanding of difficulties in adherence with MPH treatment in children with ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Kritchman, Koubi, Mimouni Bloch and Bloch.</span><span>Effect of methylphenidate on state anxiety in children with ADHD-A single dose, placebo controlled, crossover study</span></td>

					<td class="ab">The present clinical trial investigated the impact of selected SNPs in CES1 on the metabolic activity of the enzyme. For this purpose, we used methylphenidate (MPH) as a pharmacological probe and the d-RA/d-MPH (metabolite/parent drug) ratios as a measure of enzymatic activity. This metabolic ratio (MR) was validated against the AUC ratios (AUC&lt;ovid:inf&gt;d&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; &lt;ovid:inf&gt;-RA&lt;/ovid:inf&gt;/AUC&lt;ovid:inf&gt;d&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; &lt;ovid:inf&gt;-MPH&lt;/ovid:inf&gt;). CES1 SNPs from 120 volunteers were identified, and 12 SNPs fulfilling predefined inclusion criteria were analysed separately, comparing the effect of each genotype on the metabolic ratios. The SNP criteria were as follows: presence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, a minor allele frequency &gt;= 0.01 and a clearly interpretable sequencing result in at least 30% of the individuals. Each participant ingested 10 mg of racemic methylphenidate, and blood samples were drawn prior to and 3 hours after drug administration. The SNP analysis confirmed the considerable impact of rs71647871 (G143E) in exon 4 on drug metabolism. In addition, three volunteers with markedly lower median MR, indicating decreased CES1 activity, harboured the same combination of three SNPs in intron 5. The median MR for these SNPs was 8.2 for the minor allele compared to 16.4 for the major alleles (P = 0.04). Hence, one of these or the combination of these SNPs could be of clinical significance considering that the median MR of the G143E group was 5.4. The precise genetic relationship of this finding is currently unknown, as is the clinical significance.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>The present clinical trial investigated the impact of selected SNPs in CES1 on the metabolic activity of the enzyme. For this purpose, we used methylphenidate (MPH) as a pharmacological probe and the d-RA/d-MPH (metabolite/parent drug) ratios as a measure of enzymatic activity. This metabolic ratio (MR) was validated against the AUC ratios (AUC&lt;ovid:inf&gt;d&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; &lt;ovid:inf&gt;-RA&lt;/ovid:inf&gt;/AUC&lt;ovid:inf&gt;d&lt;/ovid:inf&gt; &lt;ovid:inf&gt;-MPH&lt;/ovid:inf&gt;). CES1 SNPs from 120 volunteers were identified, and 12 SNPs fulfilling predefined inclusion criteria were analysed separately, comparing the effect of each genotype on the metabolic ratios. The SNP criteria were as follows: presence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, a minor allele frequency &gt;= 0.01 and a clearly interpretable sequencing result in at least 30% of the individuals. Each participant ingested 10 mg of racemic methylphenidate, and blood samples were drawn prior to and 3 hours after drug administration. The SNP analysis confirmed the considerable impact of rs71647871 (G143E) in exon 4 on drug metabolism. In addition, three volunteers with markedly lower median MR, indicating decreased CES1 activity, harboured the same combination of three SNPs in intron 5. The median MR for these SNPs was 8.2 for the minor allele compared to 16.4 for the major alleles (P = 0.04). Hence, one of these or the combination of these SNPs could be of clinical significance considering that the median MR of the G143E group was 5.4. The precise genetic relationship of this finding is currently unknown, as is the clinical significance.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)</span><span>The impact of human CES1 genetic variation on enzyme activity assessed by ritalinic acid/methylphenidate ratios</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background: In the United States, video games are a $23.5 billion dollar industry with more than 150 million players. A new game released last year, &#034;Fortnite Battle Royale,&#034; has as many as 3.4 million users playing simultaneously on the PC platform alone. Although the game is free at first, players are encouraged to engage in microtransactions in which they pay actual money to obtain in-game cosmetic items for their digital avatars, allowing Fortnite to generate $223 million in sales in March of 2018. Employers and schools have expressed concerns that modern video gaming has adversely effected the occupational functioning of users to an extent not previously seen. Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is included in the DSM-5 as a condition warranting further study. The nine proposed symptoms for IGD are reminiscent of substance use and gambling disorders, and include preoccupation, withdrawal, tolerance, inability to reduce or stop despite a desire to do so, giving up other activities in favor of gaming, continuing to game despite significant problems, deception or covering up of amount of gaming, using gaming to escape adverse moods, and risking or losing relationships or opportunities (eg, educational and career) due to gaming.1 IGD is also included in the ICD 11.2 IGD is generally conflated with gambling addiction and internet addiction.3 Given the breadth and variety of video games available, such a broad definition may prove detrimental to the study and treatment of the disorder. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): For the two cases, the author was the psychiatry resident in charge of both patient&#039;s care during their inpatient stay. For the literature review, PubMed, Up To Date, and Cochrane were used to search and review the current literature. Both meta-analyses and case reports were reviewed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Case 1: a 31-year-old male US Army veteran with a past psychiatric history of schizoaffective disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presented to the emergency department after a suicide attempt via ingestion of his prescribed psychiatric medications. He reported that a major source of stress is his financial situation. The patient is the sole provider for both himself and his mother; his only source of income is social security disability. Despite being behind on rent and bill payments, the patient recently accumulated $10,000 in debt playing Black Desert Online, a Korean massively multiplayer online role-playing game. He spent the money on in-game currency and items to impress his online friends and to garner clout in the online world. He reports spending 10 to 12 hours a day playing the game and says he is more sociable in the game than he is in real life. Case 2: a 28-year-old male USMC veteran with a past psychiatric history of PTSD presented to the emergency department at the behest of his wife for worsening PTSD symptoms and violent outbursts. The patient had become increasingly isolative, and his flashbacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance had worsened to the point that he was frightening his family. The patient spent an ever-increasing amount of time alone playing &#034;Call of Duty&#034; and &#034;Battlefield&#034; on his Xbox One video game console. The patient stated that he does not play the games online or with others, preferring a solitary gaming experience. He reported that video games allow him to &#034;do what [he] was trained to do.&#034; The patient used games to escape from the stressors of being a husband and a father, and sometimes played the games &#034;throughout the night,&#034; impairing his sleep. Literature Review: Risk factors for IGD include young age, male sex, exposure to video games, and access to video games.1,4 The most strongly associated risk factor is male sex, which is a much stronger risk factor for IGD than for internet addiction more generally.1 Ease of access to gaming devices such as phones, computers, and so forth, has a significant impact on the addictive potential of video games.4 The most highly correlated comorbidities associated with IGD are anxiety (89%), depression (85%), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (75%). Social phobia and anxiety are also related but to a lesser extent.2 While certain meta-analyses claim there are currently no proven, evidence-based treatments for IGD given the small size and sometimes poor design of current studies in the literature,1,3 other researchers believe there is compelling early evidence for certain treatment methodologies. With regard to behavioral treatments, family-based approaches offer treatment advantages because parents and loved-ones often require education about video games and the distinction between normal gaming and IGD. Boot-camp style programs are either ineffective or counter-productive.1 Cognitive-behavioral strategies and motivational interventions have been found to be useful.1,4 With regard to psychopharmacological interventions, both bupropion and methylphenidate have been shown to be beneficial in relatively small studies.2 Bupropion is perhaps the most studied medication for IGD with success reported in various cases.5,6 In multiple studies, the side-effects of methylphenidate often limited its use.1,2 Additionally, given the numerous positive studies examining the use of opioid antagonists (eg, naltrexone and nalmefene) in behavioral addictions,7-9 these medications should be properly studied in IGD as well. IGD is in its infancy as a diagnosis, which is reflected in the paucity of large-scale, robust, and reproducible studies currently in the literature.1-4 Inconsistent conceptualization of IGD may contribute to researchers&#039; difficulties in designing and carrying out effective studies.3 The current definition is largely criticized for being too broad.2 Adoption of a clear and distinct definition of IGD in the next iteration of the DSM would be beneficial in this regard. Video games stand apart from other addictions for various reasons. They provide an avenue for users to express and experience themselves in a manner that is less impacted by ego constraints and take on a persona or alter-ego state.4 Video games are designed to decrease the latency between mood-altering behavior and subsequent reinforcement. Video games are both an increasingly important feature of the social landscape of young people and an incredibly addictive medium, operating on a variable ratio reinforcement schedule and leading to excessive dopamine release in the mesolimbic system.4 This confluence of factors makes IGD unique among the various behavioral addictions.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: In the United States, video games are a $23.5 billion dollar industry with more than 150 million players. A new game released last year, &#034;Fortnite Battle Royale,&#034; has as many as 3.4 million users playing simultaneously on the PC platform alone. Although the game is free at first, players are encouraged to engage in microtransactions in which they pay actual money to obtain in-game cosmetic items for their digital avatars, allowing Fortnite to generate $223 million in sales in March of 2018. Employers and schools have expressed concerns that modern video gaming has adversely effected the occupational functioning of users to an extent not previously seen. Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is included in the DSM-5 as a condition warranting further study. The nine proposed symptoms for IGD are reminiscent of substance use and gambling disorders, and include preoccupation, withdrawal, tolerance, inability to reduce or stop despite a desire to do so, giving up other activities in favor of gaming, continuing to game despite significant problems, deception or covering up of amount of gaming, using gaming to escape adverse moods, and risking or losing relationships or opportunities (eg, educational and career) due to gaming.1 IGD is also included in the ICD 11.2 IGD is generally conflated with gambling addiction and internet addiction.3 Given the breadth and variety of video games available, such a broad definition may prove detrimental to the study and treatment of the disorder. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): For the two cases, the author was the psychiatry resident in charge of both patient&#039;s care during their inpatient stay. For the literature review, PubMed, Up To Date, and Cochrane were used to search and review the current literature. Both meta-analyses and case reports were reviewed. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Case 1: a 31-year-old male US Army veteran with a past psychiatric history of schizoaffective disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presented to the emergency department after a suicide attempt via ingestion of his prescribed psychiatric medications. He reported that a major source of stress is his financial situation. The patient is the sole provider for both himself and his mother; his only source of income is social security disability. Despite being behind on rent and bill payments, the patient recently accumulated $10,000 in debt playing Black Desert Online, a Korean massively multiplayer online role-playing game. He spent the money on in-game currency and items to impress his online friends and to garner clout in the online world. He reports spending 10 to 12 hours a day playing the game and says he is more sociable in the game than he is in real life. Case 2: a 28-year-old male USMC veteran with a past psychiatric history of PTSD presented to the emergency department at the behest of his wife for worsening PTSD symptoms and violent outbursts. The patient had become increasingly isolative, and his flashbacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance had worsened to the point that he was frightening his family. The patient spent an ever-increasing amount of time alone playing &#034;Call of Duty&#034; and &#034;Battlefield&#034; on his Xbox One video game console. The patient stated that he does not play the games online or with others, preferring a solitary gaming experience. He reported that video games allow him to &#034;do what [he] was trained to do.&#034; The patient used games to escape from the stressors of being a husband and a father, and sometimes played the games &#034;throughout the night,&#034; impairing his sleep. Literature Review: Risk factors for IGD include young age, male sex, exposure to video games, and access to video games.1,4 The most strongly associated risk factor is male sex, which is a much stronger risk factor for IGD than for internet addiction more generally.1 Ease of access to gaming devices such as phones, computers, and so forth, has a significant impact on the addictive potential of video games.4 The most highly correlated comorbidities associated with IGD are anxiety (89%), depression (85%), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (75%). Social phobia and anxiety are also related but to a lesser extent.2 While certain meta-analyses claim there are currently no proven, evidence-based treatments for IGD given the small size and sometimes poor design of current studies in the literature,1,3 other researchers believe there is compelling early evidence for certain treatment methodologies. With regard to behavioral treatments, family-based approaches offer treatment advantages because parents and loved-ones often require education about video games and the distinction between normal gaming and IGD. Boot-camp style programs are either ineffective or counter-productive.1 Cognitive-behavioral strategies and motivational interventions have been found to be useful.1,4 With regard to psychopharmacological interventions, both bupropion and methylphenidate have been shown to be beneficial in relatively small studies.2 Bupropion is perhaps the most studied medication for IGD with success reported in various cases.5,6 In multiple studies, the side-effects of methylphenidate often limited its use.1,2 Additionally, given the numerous positive studies examining the use of opioid antagonists (eg, naltrexone and nalmefene) in behavioral addictions,7-9 these medications should be properly studied in IGD as well. IGD is in its infancy as a diagnosis, which is reflected in the paucity of large-scale, robust, and reproducible studies currently in the literature.1-4 Inconsistent conceptualization of IGD may contribute to researchers&#039; difficulties in designing and carrying out effective studies.3 The current definition is largely criticized for being too broad.2 Adoption of a clear and distinct definition of IGD in the next iteration of the DSM would be beneficial in this regard. Video games stand apart from other addictions for various reasons. They provide an avenue for users to express and experience themselves in a manner that is less impacted by ego constraints and take on a persona or alter-ego state.4 Video games are designed to decrease the latency between mood-altering behavior and subsequent reinforcement. Video games are both an increasingly important feature of the social landscape of young people and an incredibly addictive medium, operating on a variable ratio reinforcement schedule and leading to excessive dopamine release in the mesolimbic system.4 This confluence of factors makes IGD unique among the various behavioral addictions.</span><span>Internet gaming disorder: A report of two cases and a review of the literature</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background NICE guidelines (NG87)1 recognises the under 5 or pre-school ADHD and recommends ADHD-focused groupbased parent-training programme as the first-line treatment and taking advice from a specialist ADHD service/or tertiary service if above fails. NICE also reported that there was limited evidence on the efficacy of medication, with concerns and lack of evidence about the long-term effects of medication, in terms of growth and development among pre-school ADHD children. However, NICE also commented that untreated ADHD can have far-reaching, long-lasting negative impacts on a child&#039;s life and further specialist advice, ideally from a tertiary service should be sought if Parent-training programme and environmental modifications are not effective. The recommendations from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist (AACP) and the The American Academy of pediatrics (AAP)2 are slightly different. The AAP recommends that the primary care clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent-and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy as first line treatment and may prescribe Methylphenidate if the behavior therapy does not provide significant improvement. They recommend that in areas where evidence-based behavioral therapy is not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early age against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment. Methods A review of recently published literature was conducted, including meta-analyses and national guidelines. A survey of clinical experience among a cohort of ADHD specialists across the UK was also conducted. Three illustrative cases of preschool ADHD is presented to highlight the variable management approaches used. Results The literature review showed few studies on preschool ADHD from Europe/UK. A review of &#039;Pre School ADHD Treatment Study (PATS)&#039;3 on Efficacy and safety of immediate release Methylphenidate in preschool children (Greenhill et al 2006) suggested that Methylphenidate in 2.5-, 5-, and 7.5 mg doses three times daily, produced significant reductions on ADHD symptom scales compared to placebo, although effect sizes (0.4-0.8) were smaller than those cited for school-age children on the same medication. The follow up study by Vitiello et al (2015), showed about 2/3rd of participants from original PATS study were still on the medication andthe long-term pharmacotherapy of preschoolers with ADHD was heterogeneous. Conclusion Pre-school ADHD studies are predominantly from the USA. NICE guidelines tend to take a more conservative approach. Medication should be considered only if others measures have failed and after a tertiary specialist opinion. We need more UK/European studies to measure how prevalent is ADHD in pre-schoolers. Also in the UK, ADHD specific Parental training programmes are patchy which can encourage pharmacotherapy. More investment on ADHD specific parental intervention/Parental training programme is needed.</td>

Methods A review of recently published literature was conducted, including meta-analyses and national guidelines. A survey of clinical experience among a cohort of ADHD specialists across the UK was also conducted. Three illustrative cases of preschool ADHD is presented to highlight the variable management approaches used. Results The literature review showed few studies on preschool ADHD from Europe/UK. A review of &#039;Pre School ADHD Treatment Study (PATS)&#039;3 on Efficacy and safety of immediate release Methylphenidate in preschool children (Greenhill et al 2006) suggested that Methylphenidate in 2.5-, 5-, and 7.5 mg doses three times daily, produced significant reductions on ADHD symptom scales compared to placebo, although effect sizes (0.4-0.8) were smaller than those cited for school-age children on the same medication. The follow up study by Vitiello et al (2015), showed about 2/3rd of participants from original PATS study were still on the medication andthe long-term pharmacotherapy of preschoolers with ADHD was heterogeneous. Conclusion Pre-school ADHD studies are predominantly from the USA. NICE guidelines tend to take a more conservative approach. Medication should be considered only if others measures have failed and after a tertiary specialist opinion. We need more UK/European studies to measure how prevalent is ADHD in pre-schoolers. Also in the UK, ADHD specific Parental training programmes are patchy which can encourage pharmacotherapy. More investment on ADHD specific parental intervention/Parental training programme is needed.</span><span>628194095</span><span>Upadhyay D.</span><span>conference abstract [other term]</span><span>20190515</span><span>Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Annual Conference, RCPCH 2019.

					<td class="tw"><span>Background NICE guidelines (NG87)1 recognises the under 5 or pre-school ADHD and recommends ADHD-focused groupbased parent-training programme as the first-line treatment and taking advice from a specialist ADHD service/or tertiary service if above fails. NICE also reported that there was limited evidence on the efficacy of medication, with concerns and lack of evidence about the long-term effects of medication, in terms of growth and development among pre-school ADHD children. However, NICE also commented that untreated ADHD can have far-reaching, long-lasting negative impacts on a child&#039;s life and further specialist advice, ideally from a tertiary service should be sought if Parent-training programme and environmental modifications are not effective. The recommendations from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist (AACP) and the The American Academy of pediatrics (AAP)2 are slightly different. The AAP recommends that the primary care clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent-and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy as first line treatment and may prescribe Methylphenidate if the behavior therapy does not provide significant improvement. They recommend that in areas where evidence-based behavioral therapy is not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early age against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment.

					<td class="ab">Background: Primary tic disorders, notably Tourette syndrome, are very common movement disorders in childhood. However, the management of such patients still poses great therapeutic challenges to medical professionals. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Based on a synthesis of the available guidelines published in Europe, Canada, and the United States, coupled with more recent therapeutic developments, the authors provide a pragmatic guide to aid clinicians in deciding when and how to treat patients who have primary tic disorders. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): After a systematic assessment of tics and common neuropsychiatric comorbidities (primarily attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]), the first step in treatment is a comprehensive psychoeducation of patients and families that addresses the protean phenomenology of tics and associated behaviors, coping mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment options. When more active intervention beyond watchful monitoring is indicated, hierarchical evaluation of treatment targets (i.e., tics vs. comorbid behavioral symptoms) is crucial. Behavioral treatments for tics are restricted to older children and are not readily available to all centers, mainly due to the paucity of well-trained therapists. Pharmacological treatments, such as antipsychotics for tics, stimulants and atomoxetine for ADHD, and alpha2A-agonists for children with tics plus ADHD, represent widely available and effective treatment options, but safety monitoring must be provided. Combined polypharmacological and behavioral/pharmacological approaches, as well as neuromodulation strategies, remain under-investigated in this population of patients. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): The treatment of children with tics and Tourette syndrome is multifaceted. Multidisciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, psychiatry, psychology, and pediatrics may be helpful to address the complex needs of these children.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2016 The Authors.

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Primary tic disorders, notably Tourette syndrome, are very common movement disorders in childhood. However, the management of such patients still poses great therapeutic challenges to medical professionals. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Based on a synthesis of the available guidelines published in Europe, Canada, and the United States, coupled with more recent therapeutic developments, the authors provide a pragmatic guide to aid clinicians in deciding when and how to treat patients who have primary tic disorders. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): After a systematic assessment of tics and common neuropsychiatric comorbidities (primarily attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]), the first step in treatment is a comprehensive psychoeducation of patients and families that addresses the protean phenomenology of tics and associated behaviors, coping mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment options. When more active intervention beyond watchful monitoring is indicated, hierarchical evaluation of treatment targets (i.e., tics vs. comorbid behavioral symptoms) is crucial. Behavioral treatments for tics are restricted to older children and are not readily available to all centers, mainly due to the paucity of well-trained therapists. Pharmacological treatments, such as antipsychotics for tics, stimulants and atomoxetine for ADHD, and alpha2A-agonists for children with tics plus ADHD, represent widely available and effective treatment options, but safety monitoring must be provided. Combined polypharmacological and behavioral/pharmacological approaches, as well as neuromodulation strategies, remain under-investigated in this population of patients. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): The treatment of children with tics and Tourette syndrome is multifaceted. Multidisciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, psychiatry, psychology, and pediatrics may be helpful to address the complex needs of these children.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2016 The Authors.

					<td class="ab">Background: Fatigue is 1 of the most common and most disabling symptoms among patients with Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD) and has a significant impact on their quality of life. Yet the pathophysiology of fatigue is poorly understood, while its treatment is &#034;limited to an empirical approach based on plausible hypotheses.&#034;. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): PubMed was searched for articles with the key words &#034;Parkinson&#039;s disease&#034; or &#034;parkinsonism&#034; and &#034;fatigue&#034; that were published by or before August 2015. The analysis of articles, which were selected on subjective grounds, was used to review the current knowledge of pathophysiology and treatment outcomes in studies focused on fatigue in PD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Clinical and experimental findings support the view that fatigue is a primary manifestation of PD. The main hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms include abnormal basal ganglia (BG)-cortical mechanisms, particularly frontal loops, and an imbalance between neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine [DA] and serotonin), along with an altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, neuroinflammation, cardiac sympathetic denervation, etc. Pragmatic treatment of fatigue in patients with PD includes various pharmacological (dopaminergic and psychostimulant drugs, antidepressants) and nonpharmacological strategies, although current knowledge suffers from insufficient evidence to support the use of any drug or nondrug therapy.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Fatigue is 1 of the most common and most disabling symptoms among patients with Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD) and has a significant impact on their quality of life. Yet the pathophysiology of fatigue is poorly understood, while its treatment is &#034;limited to an empirical approach based on plausible hypotheses.&#034;. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): PubMed was searched for articles with the key words &#034;Parkinson&#039;s disease&#034; or &#034;parkinsonism&#034; and &#034;fatigue&#034; that were published by or before August 2015. The analysis of articles, which were selected on subjective grounds, was used to review the current knowledge of pathophysiology and treatment outcomes in studies focused on fatigue in PD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Clinical and experimental findings support the view that fatigue is a primary manifestation of PD. The main hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms include abnormal basal ganglia (BG)-cortical mechanisms, particularly frontal loops, and an imbalance between neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine [DA] and serotonin), along with an altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, neuroinflammation, cardiac sympathetic denervation, etc. Pragmatic treatment of fatigue in patients with PD includes various pharmacological (dopaminergic and psychostimulant drugs, antidepressants) and nonpharmacological strategies, although current knowledge suffers from insufficient evidence to support the use of any drug or nondrug therapy.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society</span><span>The Pathophysiology of Fatigue in Parkinson&#039;s Disease and its Pragmatic Management</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background: Swallowing deficits and freezing phenomena represent severe parkinsonian features. Freezing as a symptom occurring during swallowing has not been reported on yet. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We report on 3 patients with probable PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P) who manifested freezing of swallowing (FOS). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): All 3 patients experienced severe weight loss in recent months. At examination, 1 patient had freezing of gait. Video fluoroscopy showed nonfunctional trembling movements of the tongue and palate during chewing and volitional swallowing, with a 6- to 8-Hz frequency that is typical for freezing episodes during walking and finger tapping. These freezing episodes were accompanied by impaired oral bolus transportation. The pharyngeal phase was not relevantly affected. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): FOS represents a novel disease feature of PSP-P. The feature may have fundamental, but potentially treatable, consequences for patients&#039; health and quality of life and may be considered in patients with degenerative parkinsonism who experience severe and unexplained weight loss.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Swallowing deficits and freezing phenomena represent severe parkinsonian features. Freezing as a symptom occurring during swallowing has not been reported on yet. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We report on 3 patients with probable PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P) who manifested freezing of swallowing (FOS). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): All 3 patients experienced severe weight loss in recent months. At examination, 1 patient had freezing of gait. Video fluoroscopy showed nonfunctional trembling movements of the tongue and palate during chewing and volitional swallowing, with a 6- to 8-Hz frequency that is typical for freezing episodes during walking and finger tapping. These freezing episodes were accompanied by impaired oral bolus transportation. The pharyngeal phase was not relevantly affected. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): FOS represents a novel disease feature of PSP-P. The feature may have fundamental, but potentially treatable, consequences for patients&#039; health and quality of life and may be considered in patients with degenerative parkinsonism who experience severe and unexplained weight loss.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society</span><span>Freezing of Swallowing</span></td>

					<td class="ab">In the last 15 years, there has been a marked increase in the number of available stimulant formulations with the emphasis on long-Acting formulations, and the introduction of several novel delivery systems such as orally dissolving tablets, chewable tablets, extended-release liquid formulations, transdermal patches, and novel &#034;beaded&#034; technology. All of these formulations involve changes to the pharmaceutical delivery systems of the two existing compounds most commonly employed to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), amphetamine (AMP) and methylphenidate (MPH). In addition to these new formulations, our knowledge about the individual differences in response has advanced and contributes to a more nuanced approach to treatment. The clinician can now make increasingly informed choices about these formulations and more effectively individualize treatment in a way that had not been possible before. In the absence of reliable biomarkers that can predict individualized response to ADHD treatment, clinical knowledge about differences in MPH and AMP pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism can be utilized to personalize treatment and optimize response.

					<td class="ab">Purpose: Survivors of pediatric brain tumors often have neurodevelopmental late effects, such as inattention. Symptoms may mirror those of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which affects ~ 5-8% of the general population. This retrospective study of survivors followed at a large tertiary care center examined the prevalence of a clinical diagnosis of ADHD, and risk factors associated with ADHD diagnosis and ADHD-related medication use. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): A retrospective chart review of brain tumor survivors (n = 528), diagnosed between 2000 and 2015, who were at least 6 years old and 2 years from the end of tumor-directed therapy or from diagnosis, if no interventions were received. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the medical record. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Survivors were 55.7% male with mean age 8.15 +/- 4.4 (0.0-16.0) years at brain tumor diagnosis. The most common diagnoses were low-grade glioma, medulloblastoma, and craniopharyngioma, with 52.5% of tumors supratentorial. Of the survivors, 81.3% received surgery, 40.0% radiation therapy, and 36.6% chemotherapy. Sixty-nine survivors (13.1%) had ADHD diagnoses, 105 (19.9%) had symptoms of ADHD without diagnoses, and 64 (12.1%) had ADHD medication use. ADHD diagnosis was associated with younger age at tumor diagnosis (p = 0.05) and supratentorial tumor location (p = 0.001). ADHD diagnosis was not associated with gender, tumor type, or treatment type. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Survivors of brain tumors are at increased risk of ADHD and related symptoms. The greatest increase in risk occurs for survivors with diagnoses at younger ages and supratentorial tumors. Additional research is warranted, as select survivors may benefit from behavioral or pharmacologic ADHD treatments to optimize functioning.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</td>

					<td class="ab">In 2000, the first biphasic modified-release (MR) formulation of methylphenidate (MPH) was approved for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An immediate-release (IR) MPH pulse (22% of the dose) facilitates rapid onset of stimulant action, while the remaining MR portion of the dose provides for day-long duration of efficacy. A wide array of oral MR-MPH products has subsequently been approved that also allows for once-daily dosing, though each product is characterized by distinctive exposure time courses. This review compares each member of the current MPH armamentarium to assist in the rational selection of a specific MPH regimen for the individualized treatment of patients with ADHD. The IR portion of biphasic MPH formulations now ranges from 15%, 20%, 22%, 25%, 30%, and 37% IR-MPH, as well as a 50% IR-MPH product whose distinctly pulsatile time course closely resembles that of the pre-century &#034;gold standard&#034; twice-daily IR-MPH regimen. Further, transdermal, suspension, and orally disintegrating tablet products are now available to overcome any solid dosage form swallowing difficulties. Most of these formulations are racemic, though in 2001, a chiral switch drug IR-dexmethylphenidate (dexMPH) was approved, followed by biphasic MR-dexMPH (50% IR) in 2005. New U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) partial area under the curve (pAUC) bioavailability metrics have improved discrimination between specific generic MR-MPH products. This has resulted in two Orange Book MR-MPH products being recoded from &#034;AB&#034; (i.e., meets necessary bioequivalence requirements) to &#034;BX&#034; (i.e., insufficient data to confirm bioequivalence). The metabolic drug interaction between MPH and alcohol, which increases MPH bioavailability, potentiates euphoric effects, and heightens abuse liability, is discussed. This review concludes with brief considerations of pharmacogenomic predictors of ADHD first-line drug selection, carboxylesterase allelic variants influencing interindividual MPH metabolism, and novel MPH formulations in the regulatory pipeline.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.</td>

					<td class="ab">Central nervous system stimulants are a commonly used first-line treatment option for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Stimulants are generally well tolerated, with anorexia and insomnia the most common adverse effects. However, there are some concerns with long-term use of stimulants, such as potential growth delay. Historically, data regarding this long-term adverse effect have been conflicting. In this article, we review the newer data surrounding the effects of central nervous system stimulants on growth parameters in children with ADHD. We conducted a literature search of the PubMed database; only articles using ADHD criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision; and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, were included to ensure the most up-to-date review of literature. Nine articles were identified for relevance and quality and are discussed in this review, describing clinical observations of height and weight of adolescent or pediatric patients receiving stimulant medications for ADHD therapy. In summary, this review points toward potential associations between duration of treatment and higher doses of stimulants with decreased weight and body mass index. Furthermore, this review demonstrates that evidence is still conflicting regarding the relationship between stimulant use and significant height decreases. Future studies with higher quality of evidence are needed to observe this potential adverse effect of stimulants in children and adolescents.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.</td>

					<td class="ab">Treatment services for Internet gaming disorder are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, particularly in East Asia. This international systematic review was designed to appraise the quality standards of the gaming disorder treatment literature, a task previously undertaken by King et al. (2011) prior to the inclusion of Internet gaming disorder in Section III of the DSM-5 and &#039;Gaming disorder&#039; in the draft ICD-11. The reporting quality of 30 treatment studies conducted from 2007 to 2016 was assessed. Reporting quality was defined according to the 2010 Consolidating Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. The results reaffirmed previous criticisms of these trials, namely: (a) inconsistencies in the definition, diagnosis, and measurement of disordered use; (b) lack of randomization and blinding; (c) lack of controls; and (d) insufficient information on recruitment dates, sample characteristics, and effect sizes. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy has a larger evidence base than other therapies, it remains difficult to make definitive statements on its benefits. Study design quality has not improved over the last decade, indicating a need for greater consistency and standardization in this area. Continuing international efforts to understand the core psychopathology of gaming disorder are vital to developing a model of best practice in treatment.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 Elsevier Ltd</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Treatment services for Internet gaming disorder are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, particularly in East Asia. This international systematic review was designed to appraise the quality standards of the gaming disorder treatment literature, a task previously undertaken by King et al. (2011) prior to the inclusion of Internet gaming disorder in Section III of the DSM-5 and &#039;Gaming disorder&#039; in the draft ICD-11. The reporting quality of 30 treatment studies conducted from 2007 to 2016 was assessed. Reporting quality was defined according to the 2010 Consolidating Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. The results reaffirmed previous criticisms of these trials, namely: (a) inconsistencies in the definition, diagnosis, and measurement of disordered use; (b) lack of randomization and blinding; (c) lack of controls; and (d) insufficient information on recruitment dates, sample characteristics, and effect sizes. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy has a larger evidence base than other therapies, it remains difficult to make definitive statements on its benefits. Study design quality has not improved over the last decade, indicating a need for greater consistency and standardization in this area. Continuing international efforts to understand the core psychopathology of gaming disorder are vital to developing a model of best practice in treatment.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 Elsevier Ltd</span><span>Treatment of Internet gaming disorder: An international systematic review and CONSORT evaluation</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Introduction: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with a broad range of neuropsychological impairments that are attenuated with methylphenidate (MPH) treatment. The aim of this study was to determine how MPH effects attentional functioning in terms of reaction time (RT) in ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Eighteen pre-medicated ADHD children (7 to 12 years old) and eighteen gender matched normal controls (7 to 12 years old) were included in the study. Participants performed an auditory attention task and the RT of participants to each target response was calculated automatically. The same test was repeated 3 months after OROS-MPH administration for ADHD group. RT, RT standard deviation (RTSD), and response errors (omission and commission errors) were compared between control and pre-MPH ADHD groups, and between Pre-MPH and post-MPH ADHD groups. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Relative to control subjects, significantly longer RTs, higher RTSD and more errors of omission were observed in unmedicated ADHD children during auditory attention task. Analyses revealed significant effects of medication across all measures except commission errors. After treatment RTs were faster, RTSD values were lower, and errors of omission were attenuated compared to pre-medication condition in ADHD group. There were no significant differences in terms of commission errors between groups. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): In this study it was observed that MPH reduced RTs to stimuli, attenuated omission errors during the task in ADHD group and after 3 months of treatment ADHD children showed similar patterns in RT as compared to controls. Results suggest that when treating ADHD, it might help clinicians to evaluate objective and non-invasive cognitive outcomes such as RT, RTSD and response errors to evaluate the effects of treatment.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.</td>

The aim of this study was to determine how MPH effects attentional functioning in terms of reaction time (RT) in ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Eighteen pre-medicated ADHD children (7 to 12 years old) and eighteen gender matched normal controls (7 to 12 years old) were included in the study. Participants performed an auditory attention task and the RT of participants to each target response was calculated automatically. The same test was repeated 3 months after OROS-MPH administration for ADHD group. RT, RT standard deviation (RTSD), and response errors (omission and commission errors) were compared between control and pre-MPH ADHD groups, and between Pre-MPH and post-MPH ADHD groups. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Relative to control subjects, significantly longer RTs, higher RTSD and more errors of omission were observed in unmedicated ADHD children during auditory attention task. Analyses revealed significant effects of medication across all measures except commission errors. After treatment RTs were faster, RTSD values were lower, and errors of omission were attenuated compared to pre-medication condition in ADHD group. There were no significant differences in terms of commission errors between groups. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): In this study it was observed that MPH reduced RTs to stimuli, attenuated omission errors during the task in ADHD group and after 3 months of treatment ADHD children showed similar patterns in RT as compared to controls. Results suggest that when treating ADHD, it might help clinicians to evaluate objective and non-invasive cognitive outcomes such as RT, RTSD and response errors to evaluate the effects of treatment.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.</span><span>Effects of methylphenidate on reaction time in children with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common and may require treatment in adulthood. We aimed to investigate the treatment patterns and perinatal outcomes of women with any history of stimulant treatment for ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We used health records of the New South Wales (NSW, Australia) population to compare perinatal outcomes of women treated with stimulants (dexamphetamine or methylphenidate) for ADHD from 1982 to 2012 who gave birth between 1994 and 2012, with perinatal outcomes of women with no known ADHD or stimulant treatment (comparison cohort). Five comparison women, matched by maternal age and infant year of birth, were selected for each treated woman. Pregnancy outcome odds ratios in the two groups were adjusted for confounders including maternal age and smoking. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Of 5056 women treated for ADHD with stimulant medication, 3351 (66.3%) had stimulant treatment documented before the index pregnancy but not within 1 year before the expected date of delivery, 175 (3.5%) had stimulant treatment before and possibly during pregnancy (stimulant prescription within the 12 months directly before the expected date of the index birth and earlier), and 1530 (30.2%) had no stimulant treatment until after the index pregnancy. Treatment for ADHD at any time (before, before and during and only after the index pregnancy) was associated with reduced likelihood of spontaneous labour-odds ratios (ORs) 0.7 [0.7, 0.8], 0.7 [0.5, 0.9], and 0.7 [0.7, 0.8], respectively-and increased risk of caesarean delivery (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 1.3 [0.9, 1.8], 1.3 [1.1, 1.4]); active neonatal resuscitation (1.2 [1.0, 1.3], 1.7 [1.1, 2.7], 1.3 [1.0, 1.7]); and neonatal admission &gt; 4 h (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 1.7 [1.2, 2.4], 1.2 [1.0, 1.4]). Treatment before or before and during pregnancy was, in addition, associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia (1.2 [1.0, 1.4], 1.5 [0.8, 2.6]); preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks (1.2 [1.0, 1.3], 1.4 [0.9, 2.3]); and 1-min Apgar &lt; 7 (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 2.0 [1.4, 2.9]). Stimulant prescribing was low during pregnancy (3.5% of women received such a prescription) and dropped during the 12 months before the due date from an average of 24.7 prescriptions per month in the first 6 months to 4.5 per month in the final 6 months. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Compared with no treatment, ADHD stimulant treatment at any time was associated with small increases in the risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes; treatment before, or before and during pregnancy, was associated with additional adverse outcomes, even after a treatment-free period of several years. None of these associations can be confidently attributed to stimulant treatment; in all cases ADHD per se or correlates of it could be responsible for the association.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.</td>

Stimulant prescribing was low during pregnancy (3.5% of women received such a prescription) and dropped during the 12 months before the due date from an average of 24.7 prescriptions per month in the first 6 months to 4.5 per month in the final 6 months. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Compared with no treatment, ADHD stimulant treatment at any time was associated with small increases in the risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes; treatment before, or before and during pregnancy, was associated with additional adverse outcomes, even after a treatment-free period of several years. None of these associations can be confidently attributed to stimulant treatment; in all cases ADHD per se or correlates of it could be responsible for the association.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.</span><span>Poulton A.S.; alison.poulton@sydney.edu.au</span><span>621340813</span><span>Poulton, Alison S.; ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5867-2403</span><span>Poulton A.S.</span><span>Armstrong B.</span><span>Nanan R.K.</span><span>CNDRE</span><span>909667626</span><span>Switzerland</span><span>Copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.</span><span>atomoxetine / drug therapy</span><span>clonidine / drug therapy</span><span>dexamphetamine / drug therapy</span><span>guanfacine / drug therapy</span><span>lisdexamfetamine / drug therapy</span><span>methylphenidate / drug therapy</span><span>Obstetrics and Gynecology [10]</span><span>Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology [17]</span><span>Psychiatry [32]</span><span>Drug Literature Index [37]</span><span>201925</span><span>We would like to thank the custodians of the NSW Ministry of Health Pharmaceutical Services Drugs of Addiction database and the NSW Perinatal Data Collection for making the data available for this study, and Ms Katie Irvine, Manager of the Centre for Health Record Linkage, Sydney for advice on the study design and use of linked records.

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common and may require treatment in adulthood. We aimed to investigate the treatment patterns and perinatal outcomes of women with any history of stimulant treatment for ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): We used health records of the New South Wales (NSW, Australia) population to compare perinatal outcomes of women treated with stimulants (dexamphetamine or methylphenidate) for ADHD from 1982 to 2012 who gave birth between 1994 and 2012, with perinatal outcomes of women with no known ADHD or stimulant treatment (comparison cohort). Five comparison women, matched by maternal age and infant year of birth, were selected for each treated woman. Pregnancy outcome odds ratios in the two groups were adjusted for confounders including maternal age and smoking. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Of 5056 women treated for ADHD with stimulant medication, 3351 (66.3%) had stimulant treatment documented before the index pregnancy but not within 1 year before the expected date of delivery, 175 (3.5%) had stimulant treatment before and possibly during pregnancy (stimulant prescription within the 12 months directly before the expected date of the index birth and earlier), and 1530 (30.2%) had no stimulant treatment until after the index pregnancy. Treatment for ADHD at any time (before, before and during and only after the index pregnancy) was associated with reduced likelihood of spontaneous labour-odds ratios (ORs) 0.7 [0.7, 0.8], 0.7 [0.5, 0.9], and 0.7 [0.7, 0.8], respectively-and increased risk of caesarean delivery (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 1.3 [0.9, 1.8], 1.3 [1.1, 1.4]); active neonatal resuscitation (1.2 [1.0, 1.3], 1.7 [1.1, 2.7], 1.3 [1.0, 1.7]); and neonatal admission &gt; 4 h (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 1.7 [1.2, 2.4], 1.2 [1.0, 1.4]).

					<td class="ab">Background: Nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD)is an urgent public health concern facing the United States. Young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH)are at increased risk of NMUPD; however, community estimates of NMUPD among YEH are sparse. This current study sought to understand patterns and correlates of NMUPD in a geographically heterogeneous sample of YEH recruited from seven cities across the United States. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): From June 2016 to July 2017, 1,426 YEH (aged 18-26)were recruited from seven cities (Houston, Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, New York City, St. Louis, San Jose). Participants provided information on substance use, mental health, trauma, and sexual-risk behaviors. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess demographic, psychological, and behavioral correlates of self-reported past-month NMUPD and NMUPD types (i.e., prescription stimulant, sedative, and opioids). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Approximately 20% of participants reported past-month NMUPD. Almost 9% reported misusing prescription opioids, 8.7% misused prescription sedatives, and 6% misused prescription stimulants. Multivariable logistic regressions revealed unmet mental health needs were associated with sedative and stimulant misuse but not opioid misuse. Having suicidal thoughts was associated with opioid misuse but not sedative or stimulant misuse. Although no geographical differences emerged for stimulant and sedative misuse, youth from Denver, Phoenix, and San Jose were more likely to engage in opioid misuse relative to youth in Los Angeles. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): These findings indicate that interventions designed to address NMUPD need to be multifaceted, designed to address other risk behaviors correlated with NMUPD, and target unmet mental health needs.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier B.V.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: Nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD)is an urgent public health concern facing the United States. Young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH)are at increased risk of NMUPD; however, community estimates of NMUPD among YEH are sparse. This current study sought to understand patterns and correlates of NMUPD in a geographically heterogeneous sample of YEH recruited from seven cities across the United States. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): From June 2016 to July 2017, 1,426 YEH (aged 18-26)were recruited from seven cities (Houston, Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, New York City, St. Louis, San Jose). Participants provided information on substance use, mental health, trauma, and sexual-risk behaviors. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess demographic, psychological, and behavioral correlates of self-reported past-month NMUPD and NMUPD types (i.e., prescription stimulant, sedative, and opioids). &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Approximately 20% of participants reported past-month NMUPD. Almost 9% reported misusing prescription opioids, 8.7% misused prescription sedatives, and 6% misused prescription stimulants. Multivariable logistic regressions revealed unmet mental health needs were associated with sedative and stimulant misuse but not opioid misuse. Having suicidal thoughts was associated with opioid misuse but not sedative or stimulant misuse. Although no geographical differences emerged for stimulant and sedative misuse, youth from Denver, Phoenix, and San Jose were more likely to engage in opioid misuse relative to youth in Los Angeles. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): These findings indicate that interventions designed to address NMUPD need to be multifaceted, designed to address other risk behaviors correlated with NMUPD, and target unmet mental health needs.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 Elsevier B.V.</span><span>Prevalence and correlates of nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD)among Young adults experiencing homelessness in seven cities across the United States</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Albert Hoffman suggested that low doses of LSD might be an appropriate alternative to Ritalin. Following this possibility, a systematic exploration of the effects of &#034;microdoses,&#034; comprising hundreds of lengthy descriptive reports, was undertaken. Based on these reports, using a psychedelic in the microdose range (10 micrograms) every three days was determined to be safe across a wide variety of individuals and conditions. Over 18 months, more than a thousand individuals from 59 countries did a daily evaluation of negative and positive emotional state using the PANAS checklist plus written reports for between one week and four months. Participant reports suggested that spaced but repeated microdoses were followed by improvements in negative moods, especially depression, and increases in positive moods. Increased energy, improved work effectiveness, and improved health habits were observed in clinical and non-clinical populations. Smaller samples described alleviation of symptoms in migraine headaches, pre-menstrual syndromes, traumatic brain injury, shingles, and other conditions not previously associated with psychedelic use.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, &amp;#xa9; 2019 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Cherubism is an autosomal-dominant inherited mutation in the SH3BP2 gene on chromosome 4p16.3. It is characterized by bilateral symmetric fibro-osseous lesions that are limited to the maxilla and mandible. The lesions present in early childhood and typically spontaneously involute after puberty. Current standard practice is to reserve surgery for symptomatic or severely disfiguring cases. This report presents 3 patients with cherubism who exhibited marked reduction in tumor size with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Treatment was well tolerated, with few side effects.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 The Authors</span><span>A Paradigm Shift in the Management of Cherubism?

					<td class="ab">We present two cases that highlight the importance of non-motor symptoms in the management of tics in Tourette syndrome (TS). Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are frequent comorbidities in TS. Their presentation in TS can be significantly different from that in the general population. Failure to recognize these differences can lead to missed opportunities for effective management and to unnecessary suffering on the part of TS patients. In children, tic severity is influenced by developmental issues that may be more subtle in adults. In children and adults, tic severity is highly variable but heavily influenced by the above and other possible comorbidities of TS. These include anxiety, mood disorders, learning disabilities, and acquired maladaptive behaviors used to cope with the stress brought on by TS. Tics are also heavily influenced by external factors such as self esteem issues stemming from being repeatedly taunted by peers early on and by well-meant disciplinary strategies used by parents and teachers that may end up enabling tics over time (e.g., blaming everything on the tics, using tics to avoid expectations and responsibilities, and in school, placing unrealistic expectations and little support with tic control). We hope these cases and the suggested reading allow the reader to better recognize, prioritize, and orchestrate the various treatment paths to controlling tics in TS.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>We present two cases that highlight the importance of non-motor symptoms in the management of tics in Tourette syndrome (TS). Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are frequent comorbidities in TS. Their presentation in TS can be significantly different from that in the general population. Failure to recognize these differences can lead to missed opportunities for effective management and to unnecessary suffering on the part of TS patients. In children, tic severity is influenced by developmental issues that may be more subtle in adults. In children and adults, tic severity is highly variable but heavily influenced by the above and other possible comorbidities of TS. These include anxiety, mood disorders, learning disabilities, and acquired maladaptive behaviors used to cope with the stress brought on by TS. Tics are also heavily influenced by external factors such as self esteem issues stemming from being repeatedly taunted by peers early on and by well-meant disciplinary strategies used by parents and teachers that may end up enabling tics over time (e.g., blaming everything on the tics, using tics to avoid expectations and responsibilities, and in school, placing unrealistic expectations and little support with tic control). We hope these cases and the suggested reading allow the reader to better recognize, prioritize, and orchestrate the various treatment paths to controlling tics in TS.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</span><span>Treatment of non-motor symptoms in tourette syndrome</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Background. The strong link between dopamine and motor learning has been well-established in the animal literature with similar findings reported in healthy adults and the elderly. Objective. We aimed to conduct the first, to our knowledge, systematic review of the literature on the evidence for the effects of dopaminergic medications or genetic variations in dopamine transmission on motor recovery or learning after a nonprogressive neurological injury. Methods. A PubMed search was conducted up until April 2018 for all English articles including participants with nonprogressive neurological injury such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury; quantitative motor outcomes; and assessments of the dopaminergic system or medications. Results. The search yielded 237 articles, from which we identified 26 articles meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The vast majority of articles were related to the use of levodopa poststroke; however, several studies assessed the effects of different medications and/or were on individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy. Conclusions. The evidence suggests that a brain injury can decrease dopamine transmission and that levodopa may have a positive effect on motor outcomes poststroke, although evidence is not conclusive or consistent. Individual variations in genes related to dopamine transmission may also influence the response to motor skill training during neurorehabilitation and the extent to which dopaminergic medications or interventions can augment that response. More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.</td>

More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.</span><span>Damiano D.L.; damianod@cc.nih.gov</span><span>626963573</span><span>Bradley C.L.</span><span>Damiano D.L.</span><span>JNRHF</span><span>916495557</span><span>United States</span><span>Copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.</span><span>amantadine / special situation for pharmacovigilance</span><span>dexamphetamine / special situation for pharmacovigilance</span><span>*dopamine receptor stimulating agent / *special situation for pharmacovigilance</span><span>levodopa / special situation for pharmacovigilance</span><span>methylphenidate / special situation for pharmacovigilance</span><span>ropinirole / special situation for pharmacovigilance</span><span>rotigotine / special situation for pharmacovigilance</span><span>Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine [19]</span><span>Drug Literature Index [37]</span><span>Neurology and Neurosurgery [8]</span><span>201925</span><span>The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (Protocol #16-CC-0149).</span><span>(Bradley, Damiano) National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States</span><span>5</span><span>1545-9683</span><span>Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair</span><span>dopamine agonists</span><span>genetic variation</span><span>levodopa</span><span>neurological rehabilitation</span><span>English</span><span>adult</span><span>age</span><span>cerebral palsy</span><span>cerebrovascular accident</span><span>child</span><span>dopaminergic system</span><span>*dopaminergic transmission</span><span>drug efficacy</span><span>drug safety</span><span>genetic variation</span><span>human</span><span>motor cortex</span><span>*motor learning</span><span>*motor performance</span><span>*nervous system injury / *rehabilitation</span><span>neurorehabilitation</span><span>Review</span><span>sex difference</span><span>side effect</span><span>spinal cord injury</span><span>systematic review</span><span>traumatic brain injury</span><span>SAGE Publications Inc.

					<td class="tw"><span>Background. The strong link between dopamine and motor learning has been well-established in the animal literature with similar findings reported in healthy adults and the elderly. Objective. We aimed to conduct the first, to our knowledge, systematic review of the literature on the evidence for the effects of dopaminergic medications or genetic variations in dopamine transmission on motor recovery or learning after a nonprogressive neurological injury. Methods. A PubMed search was conducted up until April 2018 for all English articles including participants with nonprogressive neurological injury such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury; quantitative motor outcomes; and assessments of the dopaminergic system or medications. Results. The search yielded 237 articles, from which we identified 26 articles meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The vast majority of articles were related to the use of levodopa poststroke; however, several studies assessed the effects of different medications and/or were on individuals with traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy. Conclusions. The evidence suggests that a brain injury can decrease dopamine transmission and that levodopa may have a positive effect on motor outcomes poststroke, although evidence is not conclusive or consistent. Individual variations in genes related to dopamine transmission may also influence the response to motor skill training during neurorehabilitation and the extent to which dopaminergic medications or interventions can augment that response. More rigorous safety and efficacy studies of levodopa and dopaminergic medications in stroke and particularly other neurological injuries including genetic analyses are warranted.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; The Author(s) 2019.</span><span>Effects of Dopamine on Motor Recovery and Training in Adults and Children With Nonprogressive Neurological Injuries: A Systematic Review</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Narcolepsy type 1 is characterised by an increase in body weight after disease onset, frequently leading to obesity. It was suggested that this weight gain may be counteracted by treatment with sodium oxybate. We here provide longitudinal body mass index data of patients with narcolepsy type 1 after starting treatment with sodium oxybate, compared with patients in whom treatment with modafinil was initiated. Eighty-one individuals with narcolepsy type 1 fulfilled the entry criteria for this retrospective study: 59 had newly started treatment with sodium oxybate and 22 had newly started modafinil. Gender-specific differences between both treatment groups were compared using Student&#039;s t tests and mixed effect modeling. Patients using sodium oxybate lost weight, with a mean body mass index decrease of 2.56 kg/m&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; between the first and last measurement (women; p =.001) and 0.84 kg/m&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; (men; p =.006). Patients using modafinil, however, gained weight, with a mean body mass index increase of 0.57 kg/m&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; (women; p =.033) and 0.67 kg/m&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; (men; p =.122). Medication (p =.006) and baseline body mass index (p =.032) were predictors for body mass index decrease. In conclusion, treatment with sodium oxybate is associated with a body mass index reduction in narcolepsy type 1, whereas modafinil treatment is not.

					<td class="tw"><span>Narcolepsy type 1 is characterised by an increase in body weight after disease onset, frequently leading to obesity. It was suggested that this weight gain may be counteracted by treatment with sodium oxybate. We here provide longitudinal body mass index data of patients with narcolepsy type 1 after starting treatment with sodium oxybate, compared with patients in whom treatment with modafinil was initiated. Eighty-one individuals with narcolepsy type 1 fulfilled the entry criteria for this retrospective study: 59 had newly started treatment with sodium oxybate and 22 had newly started modafinil. Gender-specific differences between both treatment groups were compared using Student&#039;s t tests and mixed effect modeling. Patients using sodium oxybate lost weight, with a mean body mass index decrease of 2.56 kg/m&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; between the first and last measurement (women; p =.001) and 0.84 kg/m&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; (men; p =.006). Patients using modafinil, however, gained weight, with a mean body mass index increase of 0.57 kg/m&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; (women; p =.033) and 0.67 kg/m&lt;ovid:sup&gt;2&lt;/ovid:sup&gt; (men; p =.122). Medication (p =.006) and baseline body mass index (p =.032) were predictors for body mass index decrease. In conclusion, treatment with sodium oxybate is associated with a body mass index reduction in narcolepsy type 1, whereas modafinil treatment is not. This effect is most pronounced in those who already have a higher baseline body mass index.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 The Authors.

					<td class="ab">Background: The number of reports of serious adverse effects and intoxication after the use of the new drug 4-fluoroamphetamine (4-FA) increases. At the Emergency Department of the OLVG-Oost Hospital in Amsterdam, an on-site drug test, the Triage TOX Drug Screen, is available to assist in a rapid diagnosis. In less urgent cases, an EMIT II Plus immunoassay is used to determine semiquantitatively the presence of drugs of abuse (DOA). The antibodies in these immunoassays are designed to detect classic DOA and its urinary metabolites. Amphetamine-like drugs that may cause serious toxicity or impairment may not cross-react with the available immunoassay kits, and therefore may stay undetected. The question arises as to whether 4-FA and paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) are detectable in the toxicological screening procedures commonly used for testing in urine. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Synthetic urine was spiked with the drug under investigation to create spiking standards of 50, 100, 250, 500, 2500, and 5000 ng/mL. Urine drug screens were performed on the automated analyzer Biosite Triage MeterPro using the Triage TOX Drug Screen test and on a Siemens Drug Testing System Viva-E using the EMIT II Plus Ecstasy Assay and the EMIT II Plus Amphetamines Assay. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): In this concentration range, the EMIT II Plus did not screen positive for PMMA, but there was some cross-reactivity for PMMA on the EMIT II Plus Ecstasy assay. The Triage TOX Drug Screen did test positive for PMMA at a concentration of 2500 ng/mL. The EMIT II Plus Amphetamines did test positive for 4-FA at a concentration of 5000 ng/mL, whereas the Ecstasy [3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] assay only showed low cross-reactivity for 4-FA. The Triage TOX Drug Screen did not test positive for 4-FA. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): The available immunoassays lack sensitivity to detect 4-FA and PMMA in lower urine concentrations. Awareness of the fact that novel DOA may lead to false-negative urinary drug tests is of great importance.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

					<td class="tw"><span>Background: The number of reports of serious adverse effects and intoxication after the use of the new drug 4-fluoroamphetamine (4-FA) increases. At the Emergency Department of the OLVG-Oost Hospital in Amsterdam, an on-site drug test, the Triage TOX Drug Screen, is available to assist in a rapid diagnosis. In less urgent cases, an EMIT II Plus immunoassay is used to determine semiquantitatively the presence of drugs of abuse (DOA). The antibodies in these immunoassays are designed to detect classic DOA and its urinary metabolites. Amphetamine-like drugs that may cause serious toxicity or impairment may not cross-react with the available immunoassay kits, and therefore may stay undetected. The question arises as to whether 4-FA and paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) are detectable in the toxicological screening procedures commonly used for testing in urine. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): Synthetic urine was spiked with the drug under investigation to create spiking standards of 50, 100, 250, 500, 2500, and 5000 ng/mL. Urine drug screens were performed on the automated analyzer Biosite Triage MeterPro using the Triage TOX Drug Screen test and on a Siemens Drug Testing System Viva-E using the EMIT II Plus Ecstasy Assay and the EMIT II Plus Amphetamines Assay. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): In this concentration range, the EMIT II Plus did not screen positive for PMMA, but there was some cross-reactivity for PMMA on the EMIT II Plus Ecstasy assay. The Triage TOX Drug Screen did test positive for PMMA at a concentration of 2500 ng/mL. The EMIT II Plus Amphetamines did test positive for 4-FA at a concentration of 5000 ng/mL, whereas the Ecstasy [3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] assay only showed low cross-reactivity for 4-FA. The Triage TOX Drug Screen did not test positive for 4-FA. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): The available immunoassays lack sensitivity to detect 4-FA and PMMA in lower urine concentrations. Awareness of the fact that novel DOA may lead to false-negative urinary drug tests is of great importance.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

					<td class="ab">Smoking cessation is a public health priority to reduce smoking-related morbidity and mortality. However, weight gain is a known primary reason for not trying to quit smoking. The aim of the current study was to investigate differences in weight gain associated with different pharmacological smoking cessation interventions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported weight gain related to pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation were analysed using network meta-analysis with a random effects model. Thirty-one RCTs with 5650 participants were included. Ten drugs and 22 regimens were identified. Nicotine patches plus fluoxetine, topiramate with/without nicotine patches, nicotine patches plus methylphenidate, nicotine spray/gum/lozenges, high-dose nicotine patches (42 mg/21 mg), naltrexone with/without nicotine patches, or bupropion with/without nicotine patches were associated with less weight gain than the placebo/control arm. Nicotine patches plus fluoxetine were associated with the least weight gain of all smoking cessation treatments. In addition, the nicotine patch plus topiramate and nicotine inhaler was associated with the best success rate and the least dropout rate, respectively. Overall, the nicotine patch 14 mg plus fluoxetine 40 mg, nicotine patch 14 mg plus fluoxetine 20 mg, and topiramate 200 mg would be the three best pharmacologic treatments based upon both weight gain effect and success rate.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 World Obesity Federation</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Smoking cessation is a public health priority to reduce smoking-related morbidity and mortality. However, weight gain is a known primary reason for not trying to quit smoking. The aim of the current study was to investigate differences in weight gain associated with different pharmacological smoking cessation interventions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported weight gain related to pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation were analysed using network meta-analysis with a random effects model. Thirty-one RCTs with 5650 participants were included. Ten drugs and 22 regimens were identified. Nicotine patches plus fluoxetine, topiramate with/without nicotine patches, nicotine patches plus methylphenidate, nicotine spray/gum/lozenges, high-dose nicotine patches (42 mg/21 mg), naltrexone with/without nicotine patches, or bupropion with/without nicotine patches were associated with less weight gain than the placebo/control arm. Nicotine patches plus fluoxetine were associated with the least weight gain of all smoking cessation treatments. In addition, the nicotine patch plus topiramate and nicotine inhaler was associated with the best success rate and the least dropout rate, respectively. Overall, the nicotine patch 14 mg plus fluoxetine 40 mg, nicotine patch 14 mg plus fluoxetine 20 mg, and topiramate 200 mg would be the three best pharmacologic treatments based upon both weight gain effect and success rate.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 World Obesity Federation</span><span>Effects of different pharmacologic smoking cessation treatments on body weight changes and success rates in patients with nicotine dependence: A network meta-analysis</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently co-occurs with substance use disorders and has some overlapping symptoms with mild cognitive impairment, including executive functions. We wanted to investigate whether patients with ADHD have an excess risk of mild cognitive impairment-like symptoms, as defined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Second, we assessed the impact of ADHD medication on the dichotomized MoCA for patients with ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): The participants in this study were 129 inpatients at seven treatment clinics in Norway. All were screened with the MoCA. We calculated relative risk estimates (RR) for scoring in the mild cognitive impairment range (&lt; 26) for those having ADHD. Finally, we calculated the RR for the patients within the ADHD group who were taking medication. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Of the 129 participants included in the analyses, 38 (29.5%) scored below the MoCA threshold (&lt; 26), and 24 (18.6%) had ADHD that was diagnosed before or during the inpatient treatment. Of the 105 participants without ADHD, 31 (29.5%) scored below the threshold. Seven (29.2%) of those with ADHD scored below the threshold. The risk of scoring in the mild cognitive impairment range for those with and without ADHD was equal (RR = 0.98). Of the 24 patients with ADHD, 9 (37.5%) were taking medication at the time of testing. One of the patients taking medication scored below the threshold compared to six of those not taking medication. This suggests a 72% lower risk of mild cognitive impairment-like symptoms when taking medication (RR = 0.28); however, the effect was not significant. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): We revealed no excess risk of mild cognitive impairment-like symptoms for the ADHD group. However, within the ADHD group, there was a possible lower risk of mild cognitive impairment-like symptoms for patients taking medication. These results suggest that there may be a confounding overlap of symptoms between ADHD and cognitive function screens that necessitates adequate assessment and treatment of ADHD before screening or measuring cognitive function.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, &amp;#xa9; 2018 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently co-occurs with substance use disorders and has some overlapping symptoms with mild cognitive impairment, including executive functions. We wanted to investigate whether patients with ADHD have an excess risk of mild cognitive impairment-like symptoms, as defined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Second, we assessed the impact of ADHD medication on the dichotomized MoCA for patients with ADHD. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Method(s): The participants in this study were 129 inpatients at seven treatment clinics in Norway. All were screened with the MoCA. We calculated relative risk estimates (RR) for scoring in the mild cognitive impairment range (&lt; 26) for those having ADHD. Finally, we calculated the RR for the patients within the ADHD group who were taking medication. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): Of the 129 participants included in the analyses, 38 (29.5%) scored below the MoCA threshold (&lt; 26), and 24 (18.6%) had ADHD that was diagnosed before or during the inpatient treatment. Of the 105 participants without ADHD, 31 (29.5%) scored below the threshold. Seven (29.2%) of those with ADHD scored below the threshold. The risk of scoring in the mild cognitive impairment range for those with and without ADHD was equal (RR = 0.98). Of the 24 patients with ADHD, 9 (37.5%) were taking medication at the time of testing. One of the patients taking medication scored below the threshold compared to six of those not taking medication. This suggests a 72% lower risk of mild cognitive impairment-like symptoms when taking medication (RR = 0.28); however, the effect was not significant. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): We revealed no excess risk of mild cognitive impairment-like symptoms for the ADHD group. However, within the ADHD group, there was a possible lower risk of mild cognitive impairment-like symptoms for patients taking medication. These results suggest that there may be a confounding overlap of symptoms between ADHD and cognitive function screens that necessitates adequate assessment and treatment of ADHD before screening or measuring cognitive function.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018, &amp;#xa9; 2018 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</span><span>The Relation Between ADHD Medication and Mild Cognitive Impairment, as Assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in Patients Entering Substance Use Disorder Inpatient Treatment</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Successful treatment of pediatric disorders has necessitated the development of alternative medication formulations, as children may prefer alternative dosage forms to tablets or capsules. This is especially true for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is one of the most common chronic pediatric conditions and often involves children with a variety of overlapping physical, psychological, or neurodevelopmental disorders. A special challenge for developing alternative dosage forms for ADHD treatment is the incorporation of a once-daily long-acting formulation. Traditional ADHD medication formulations have been limited, and issues surrounding prescribed dosing regimens - including poor medication adherence, difficulty swallowing, and the lack of dosing titration options - persist in ADHD treatment. In other disease areas, the development of alternative formulations has provided options for patients who have issues with consuming solid dosage forms, particularly children and individuals with developmental disorders. In the light of these new developments, several alternative formulations for ADHD medications are under development or have recently become available. This article reviews the various strategies for developing alternative dosage forms in other disease areas and discusses the application of these strategies in ADHD treatment. Alternative dosage forms may increase medication adherence, compliance, and patient preference and, therefore, improve the overall treatment for ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 Cambridge University Press.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Successful treatment of pediatric disorders has necessitated the development of alternative medication formulations, as children may prefer alternative dosage forms to tablets or capsules. This is especially true for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is one of the most common chronic pediatric conditions and often involves children with a variety of overlapping physical, psychological, or neurodevelopmental disorders. A special challenge for developing alternative dosage forms for ADHD treatment is the incorporation of a once-daily long-acting formulation. Traditional ADHD medication formulations have been limited, and issues surrounding prescribed dosing regimens - including poor medication adherence, difficulty swallowing, and the lack of dosing titration options - persist in ADHD treatment. In other disease areas, the development of alternative formulations has provided options for patients who have issues with consuming solid dosage forms, particularly children and individuals with developmental disorders. In the light of these new developments, several alternative formulations for ADHD medications are under development or have recently become available. This article reviews the various strategies for developing alternative dosage forms in other disease areas and discusses the application of these strategies in ADHD treatment. Alternative dosage forms may increase medication adherence, compliance, and patient preference and, therefore, improve the overall treatment for ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 Cambridge University Press.</span><span>Beyond the pill: New medication delivery options for ADHD</span><span>Neos Therapeutics [United States]</span><span>Noven Therapeutics [United States]</span><span>Pfizer [United States]</span><span>Shionogi [United States]</span><span>Tris Pharma [United States]</span><span>adzenys xr odt: Neos Therapeutics [United States]</span><span>daytrana: Noven Therapeutics [United States]</span><span>dyanavel: Tris Pharma [United States]</span><span>methylin: Shionogi [United States]</span><span>quillichew er: Pfizer [United States]</span><span>quillivant xr: Pfizer [United States]</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was first discovered in professional boxers after they exhibited memory impairments, mood and behavioral changes after years of boxing. However, there is now a growing acceptance that CTE can develop in athletes of other sports due to the repetitive head trauma they receive. We present a case of a middle-aged male who presented with worsening memory, poor concentration, and behavioral changes for a year. On further cognitive testing, it was revealed that he had difficulties with short-term memory and processing speed as well as difficulties in organizing and multitasking. He had been practicing mixed martial arts (MMA) for 10 years, and later was an instructor of the sport. Through a detailed examination of his history, it was discovered that he sustained recurrent minor head concussions due to his line of work. To date, there has been limited large-scale research on head trauma in MMA. There is thus an urgent need for more studies in this area as CTE can be a chronic and debilitating illness with incapacitating neuropsychiatric sequelae. This case highlights the importance of public awareness of the risks of MMA and the dangers it poses to the brain, especially with more young people being attracted to this sport.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 by the authors.

					<td class="tw"><span>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was first discovered in professional boxers after they exhibited memory impairments, mood and behavioral changes after years of boxing. However, there is now a growing acceptance that CTE can develop in athletes of other sports due to the repetitive head trauma they receive. We present a case of a middle-aged male who presented with worsening memory, poor concentration, and behavioral changes for a year. On further cognitive testing, it was revealed that he had difficulties with short-term memory and processing speed as well as difficulties in organizing and multitasking. He had been practicing mixed martial arts (MMA) for 10 years, and later was an instructor of the sport. Through a detailed examination of his history, it was discovered that he sustained recurrent minor head concussions due to his line of work. To date, there has been limited large-scale research on head trauma in MMA. There is thus an urgent need for more studies in this area as CTE can be a chronic and debilitating illness with incapacitating neuropsychiatric sequelae. This case highlights the importance of public awareness of the risks of MMA and the dangers it poses to the brain, especially with more young people being attracted to this sport.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 by the authors.

Additionally, 5.0% of the respondents reported their ADRs to Lareb. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): Collaboration with patient organizations provide useful insight into patients&#039; experiences with drug use and ADRs taking into account establishing clear &#039;rules of engagement&#039;. An active approach to collaborate with patient organizations is a way forward to gain more information about drug use and ADRs in a selective cohort.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, &amp;#xa9; 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</span><span>Collaboration between patient and pharmacovigilance organizations to gain insight into adults&#039; experiences with drug use and ADRs for the treatment of ADHD</span></td>

					<td class="ab">15q13.3 syndrome is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological disorders. Among a cohort of 150 neurodevelopmental cases, we identified two patients with two close proximity interstitial hemizygous deletions on chromosome 15q13. Using high-density microarrays, we characterized these deletions and their approximate breakpoints. The second deletion in both patients overlaps in a small area containing CHRNA7 where the gene is partially deleted. The CHRNA7 is considered a strong candidate for the 15q13.3 deletion syndrome&#039;s pathogenicity. Patient 1 has cognitive impairment, learning disabilities, hyperactivity and subtle dysmorphic features whereas patient 2 has mild language impairment with speech difficulty, mild dysmorphia, heart defect and interestingly a high IQ that has not been reported in 15q13.3 syndrome patients before. Our study presents first report of such two successive deletions in 15q13.3 syndrome patients and a high IQ in a 15q13.3 syndrome patient. Our study expands the breakpoints and phenotypic features related to 15q13.3 syndrome.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 The Author(s).</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>15q13.3 syndrome is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological disorders. Among a cohort of 150 neurodevelopmental cases, we identified two patients with two close proximity interstitial hemizygous deletions on chromosome 15q13. Using high-density microarrays, we characterized these deletions and their approximate breakpoints. The second deletion in both patients overlaps in a small area containing CHRNA7 where the gene is partially deleted. The CHRNA7 is considered a strong candidate for the 15q13.3 deletion syndrome&#039;s pathogenicity. Patient 1 has cognitive impairment, learning disabilities, hyperactivity and subtle dysmorphic features whereas patient 2 has mild language impairment with speech difficulty, mild dysmorphia, heart defect and interestingly a high IQ that has not been reported in 15q13.3 syndrome patients before. Our study presents first report of such two successive deletions in 15q13.3 syndrome patients and a high IQ in a 15q13.3 syndrome patient. Our study expands the breakpoints and phenotypic features related to 15q13.3 syndrome.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019 The Author(s).</span><span>First report of two successive deletions on chromosome 15q13 cytogenetic bands in a boy and girl: Additional data to 15q13.3 syndrome with a report of high IQ patient</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders. We carried out this comparison of multiple treatments based on sufficient data in attempt to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADHD medication for children and adolescents. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Database were used to search for relevant articles. Changes in the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) scores and the Conners&#039; Parent Rating Scale-Revised (CPRS) scores were used as outcomes for efficacy. Withdrawals due to all-cause, adverse effects and lack of efficacy were defined as primary outcomes evaluating the safety of such medications. Both pair-wise and network meta-analyses were performed. Efficacy and safety of atomoxetine (ATX), bupropion (BUP), clonidine hydrochloride (CLON), guanfacine extended release (GXR), lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), and methylphenidate (MPH) were evaluated. LDX has the highest efficacy and a relatively lower rate of adverse effects compared to BUP, CLON and GXR. MPH has the lowest incidence rate of adverse effects and takes second place concerning ADHD-RS scores and third place concerning CPRS scores. ATX has the lowest incidence rate of all-cause withdrawals. The efficacy of ATX seems, however, to be lower than CLON, GXR, LDX and MPH. Adversely, BUP has the highest incidence rate of withdrawals and the second highest probability of causing adverse effects as well as lack of efficacy; therefore it should not be recommended as a treatment for ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders. We carried out this comparison of multiple treatments based on sufficient data in attempt to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADHD medication for children and adolescents. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Database were used to search for relevant articles. Changes in the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) scores and the Conners&#039; Parent Rating Scale-Revised (CPRS) scores were used as outcomes for efficacy. Withdrawals due to all-cause, adverse effects and lack of efficacy were defined as primary outcomes evaluating the safety of such medications. Both pair-wise and network meta-analyses were performed. Efficacy and safety of atomoxetine (ATX), bupropion (BUP), clonidine hydrochloride (CLON), guanfacine extended release (GXR), lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), and methylphenidate (MPH) were evaluated. LDX has the highest efficacy and a relatively lower rate of adverse effects compared to BUP, CLON and GXR. MPH has the lowest incidence rate of adverse effects and takes second place concerning ADHD-RS scores and third place concerning CPRS scores. ATX has the lowest incidence rate of all-cause withdrawals. The efficacy of ATX seems, however, to be lower than CLON, GXR, LDX and MPH. Adversely, BUP has the highest incidence rate of withdrawals and the second highest probability of causing adverse effects as well as lack of efficacy; therefore it should not be recommended as a treatment for ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</span><span>An Evaluation on the Efficacy and Safety of Treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents: a Comparison of Multiple Treatments</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Most neurodegenerative diseases are known to affect several aspects of brain function, including neurotransmitter systems, metabolic and functional connectivity. Diseases are generally characterized by common clinical characteristics across subjects, but there are also significant inter-subject variations. It is thus reasonable to expect that in terms of brain function, such clinical behaviors will be related to a general overall multi-system pattern of disease-induced alterations and additional brain system-specific abnormalities; these additional abnormalities would be indicative of a possible unique system response to disease or subject-specific propensity to a specific clinical progression. Based on the above considerations we introduce and validate the use of a joint pattern analysis approach, canonical correlation analysis and orthogonal signal correction, to analyze multi-tracer PET data to identify common (reflecting functional similarities)and unique (reflecting functional differences)information provided by each tracer/target. We apply the method to [&lt;ovid:sup&gt;11&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;C]-DTBZ (VMAT2 marker)and [&lt;ovid:sup&gt;11&lt;/ovid:sup&gt;C]-MP (DAT marker)data from 15 early Parkinson&#039;s disease (PD)subjects; the behavior of these two tracers/targets is well characterized providing robust reference information for the method&#039;s outcome. Highly significant common subject profiles were identified that decomposed the characteristic dopaminergic changes into three distinct orthogonal spatial patterns: 1)disease-induced asymmetry between the less and more affected dorsal striatum; 2)disease-induced gradient with caudate and ventral striatum being relatively spared compared to putamen; 3)progressive loss in the less affected striatum, which correlated significantly with disease duration (p &lt; 0.01 for DTBZ, p &lt; 0.05 for MP). These common spatial patterns reproduce all known aspects of these two targets/tracers. In addition, orthogonality of the patterns may indicate different mechanisms underlying disease initiation or progression. Information unique to each tracer revealed a residual striatal asymmetry when targeting VMAT2, consistent with the notion that VMAT2 density is highly related to terminal degeneration; and a residual DAT disease-induced gradient in the striatum with relative DAT preservation in the substantia nigra. This finding may be indicative either of a possible DAT specific early disease compensation and/or related to disease origin. These results demonstrate the applicability and relevance of the joint pattern analysis approach to datasets obtained with two PET tracers; this data driven method, while recapitulating known aspects of the PD-induced tracer/target behaviour, was found to be statistically more robust and provided additional information on (i)correlated behaviors of the two systems, identified as orthogonal patterns, possibly reflecting different disease-induced alterations and (ii)system specific effects of disease. It is thus expected that this approach will be very well suited to the analysis of multi-tracer and/or multi-modality data and to relating the outcomes to different aspects of disease.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019</td>

					<td class="ab">Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely prescribed drug for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Findings in the literature suggest that the effects of MPH on memory may result from increased extracellular levels of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). Here, we report that the systemic administration of MPH before the acquisition phase in a social discrimination task impaired the retrieval of the social recognition memory (SRM), but made it state-dependent: another administration of MPH before the retention test recovered the SRM. We observed that the induction of state dependency by MPH relies on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), but not on the CA1 region of the hippocampus (CA1). Also, the inhibitors of NE and DA, nisoxetine and GBR12909, respectively, restored the SRM when infused into the vmPFC. Only the GBR12909 was able to restore the SRM in the CA1, whereas nisoxetine could not restore and even caused an impairment on memory retrieval when infused alone before the retention test. The data suggest that the state-dependence of SRM induced by MPH depends on an influence of both catecholamines on the vmPFC, while NE inhibits the retrieval of SRM on the hippocampus.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018</td>

					<td class="ab">Objectives: We report on a chronic hemiparetic patient whose gait recovery was delayed until healing of an injured corticoreticulospinal tract (CRT), which was demonstrated on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Casepresentation: A 71-year-old female presented with complete paralysis of the right extremities resulting from a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. At 5 months after onset, when she was admitted for rehabilitation after undergoing rehabilitation at the previous university hospital, she presented with severe weakness of the right leg (manual muscle test: 0 ~ 2- score) and could not even stand. She received comprehensive rehabilitative therapy for 32 months after the onset. Motor weakness of her right leg improved to the point that she was able to extend her knee on gravity-eliminated position at 11 months and against some resistance at 30 months after onset. She was able to walk independently at 30 months after onset. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): The left CRT was discontinuous at the basal ganglia level on 5-month DTT. This discontinuation elongated to the cerebral cortex on 32-month DTT, whereas on 32-month DTT, the right CRT had become thicker compared with that on 5-month DTT. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): An injured CRT healed in a patient who was able to walk independently after approximately 2 years of rehabilitation starting 5 months after the onset of intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 the Author(s).</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Objectives: We report on a chronic hemiparetic patient whose gait recovery was delayed until healing of an injured corticoreticulospinal tract (CRT), which was demonstrated on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Casepresentation: A 71-year-old female presented with complete paralysis of the right extremities resulting from a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. At 5 months after onset, when she was admitted for rehabilitation after undergoing rehabilitation at the previous university hospital, she presented with severe weakness of the right leg (manual muscle test: 0 ~ 2- score) and could not even stand. She received comprehensive rehabilitative therapy for 32 months after the onset. Motor weakness of her right leg improved to the point that she was able to extend her knee on gravity-eliminated position at 11 months and against some resistance at 30 months after onset. She was able to walk independently at 30 months after onset. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Result(s): The left CRT was discontinuous at the basal ganglia level on 5-month DTT. This discontinuation elongated to the cerebral cortex on 32-month DTT, whereas on 32-month DTT, the right CRT had become thicker compared with that on 5-month DTT. &lt;ovid:br/&gt;Conclusion(s): An injured CRT healed in a patient who was able to walk independently after approximately 2 years of rehabilitation starting 5 months after the onset of intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2017 the Author(s).</span><span>Delayed gait recovery with recovery of an injured corticoreticulospinal tract in a chronic hemiparetic patient: A case report</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Introduction: Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), with deficits observed across several domains (e.g., executive function, memory, attention). While depression alone is disabling, patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments, poorer clinical recovery, and reduced quality of life. Consequently, it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD. Areas covered: This review spans psychological, physical, and pharmacological treatment approaches for cognitive dysfunction in depression. Where possible, the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains (e.g., attention), and highlight the differential mechanisms which underpin cognitive improvement. In addition, the roles of adjunctive cognitive treatments (e.g., exercise), and the possible side effects and drawbacks of specific treatments are explored. Expert opinion: Psychological treatments typically confer cognitive improvement alongside functional and/or clinical recovery; however, the efficacy of cognitive training and cognitive behavioral therapy to longitudinal cognitive improvement remains to be established. Recently developed pharmacological agents may improve cognition by reducing low-grade inflammation and promoting neurogenesis; however, the pro-cognitive effects of typical antidepressants are limited. Integrated approaches which emphasize cognitive recovery alongside clinical and functional improvement may be key to advancing patient outcomes.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, &amp;#xa9; 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Introduction: Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), with deficits observed across several domains (e.g., executive function, memory, attention). While depression alone is disabling, patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments, poorer clinical recovery, and reduced quality of life. Consequently, it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD. Areas covered: This review spans psychological, physical, and pharmacological treatment approaches for cognitive dysfunction in depression. Where possible, the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains (e.g., attention), and highlight the differential mechanisms which underpin cognitive improvement. In addition, the roles of adjunctive cognitive treatments (e.g., exercise), and the possible side effects and drawbacks of specific treatments are explored. Expert opinion: Psychological treatments typically confer cognitive improvement alongside functional and/or clinical recovery; however, the efficacy of cognitive training and cognitive behavioral therapy to longitudinal cognitive improvement remains to be established. Recently developed pharmacological agents may improve cognition by reducing low-grade inflammation and promoting neurogenesis; however, the pro-cognitive effects of typical antidepressants are limited. Integrated approaches which emphasize cognitive recovery alongside clinical and functional improvement may be key to advancing patient outcomes.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2019, &amp;#xa9; 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</span><span>Contemporary methods of improving cognitive dysfunction in clinical depression</span></td>

Plasma steroid and D-amphetamine levels were determined up to 24 h. Delayed increase and peak levels of plasma D-amphetamine concentrations were observed following lisdexamfetamine treatment compared with D-amphetamine administration, however the maximal concentrations and total exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) were similar. Lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine significantly enhanced plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, glucocorticoids (cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol), androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and DELTA4-androstene-3,17-dione [androstenedione]), and progesterone (only in men) compared with placebo. Steroid concentration-time curves were shifted to later time points due to a non-significantly later onset following lisdexamfetamine administration than after D-amphetamine, however maximal plasma steroid concentrations and AUCs did not differ between the active treatments. None of the active treatments altered plasma levels of the mineralocorticoids aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone or the androgen testosterone compared with placebo. The effects of the amphetamines on glucocorticoid production were similar to those that were previously reported for methylphenidate (60 mg) but weaker than those for the serotonin releaser 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 125 mg) or direct serotonin receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 0.2 mg). Lisdexamfetamine produced comparable HPA axis activation and had similar pharmacokinetics than D-amphetamine, except for a delayed time of onset.

					<td class="tw"><span>The novel D-amphetamine prodrug lisdexamfetamine is applied to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). D-Amphetamine releases dopamine and norepinephrine and stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which may contribute to its reinforcing effects and risk of abuse. However, no data is currently available on the effects of lisdexamfetamine on circulating steroids. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study evaluated the effects of equimolar doses of D-amphetamine (40 mg) and lisdexamfetamine (100 mg) and placebo on circulating steroids in 24 healthy subjects. Plasma steroid and D-amphetamine levels were determined up to 24 h. Delayed increase and peak levels of plasma D-amphetamine concentrations were observed following lisdexamfetamine treatment compared with D-amphetamine administration, however the maximal concentrations and total exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) were similar. Lisdexamfetamine and D-amphetamine significantly enhanced plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, glucocorticoids (cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol), androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and DELTA4-androstene-3,17-dione [androstenedione]), and progesterone (only in men) compared with placebo. Steroid concentration-time curves were shifted to later time points due to a non-significantly later onset following lisdexamfetamine administration than after D-amphetamine, however maximal plasma steroid concentrations and AUCs did not differ between the active treatments. None of the active treatments altered plasma levels of the mineralocorticoids aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone or the androgen testosterone compared with placebo. The effects of the amphetamines on glucocorticoid production were similar to those that were previously reported for methylphenidate (60 mg) but weaker than those for the serotonin releaser 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 125 mg) or direct serotonin receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 0.2 mg). Lisdexamfetamine produced comparable HPA axis activation and had similar pharmacokinetics than D-amphetamine, except for a delayed time of onset. Thus, serotonin (MDMA, LSD) may more effectively stimulate the HPA axis than dopamine and norepinephrine (D-amphetamine).&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Elsevier Ltd</span><span>Effects of lisdexamfetamine on plasma steroid concentrations compared with D-amphetamine in healthy subjects: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study</span><span>Hanseler [Switzerland]</span><span>Opopharma [Switzerland]</span></td>

					<td class="ab">Irritability and hyperactivity are common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Because pharmacological treatments may have adverse effects, and despite limited evidence, caregivers/parents often use dietary supplements such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to address these behavioural symptoms. As a secondary objective of the VIDOMA (Vitamin D and Omega-3 in ASD) trial, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D, omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid [omega-3 LCPUFA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)], or both on irritability and hyperactivity. New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5-8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722 mg/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU/day vitamin D + 722 mg/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity. Biomarkers (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and omega-3 index) and primary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-months. Out of 111 children who completed baseline data collection, 66% completed the study (VID = 19, OM = 23, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). After 12 months, children receiving OM (-5.0 +/- 5.0, P = 0.001) and VID (-4.0+/-4.9, P = 0.01) had greater reduction in irritability than placebo (0.8+/-6.1). Compared to placebo, children on VID also had greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.2+/-6.3 vs. -0.8+/-5.6, P = 0.047). Serum 25(OH)D concentration (nmol/L, mean+/-SD) increased by 27+/-14 in VID and by 36+/-17 in VIDOM groups (P &lt; 0.0001), and omega-3 index (%, median (25th, 75th percentiles)) by 4.4 (3.3, 5.9) in OM and by 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) in VIDOM groups (P &lt; 0.0001), indicating a good compliance rate. The results indicate that vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA reduced irritability symptoms in children with ASD. Vitamin D also reduced hyperactivity symptoms in these children.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Elsevier Ltd</td>

					<td class="tw"><span>Irritability and hyperactivity are common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Because pharmacological treatments may have adverse effects, and despite limited evidence, caregivers/parents often use dietary supplements such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to address these behavioural symptoms. As a secondary objective of the VIDOMA (Vitamin D and Omega-3 in ASD) trial, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D, omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid [omega-3 LCPUFA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)], or both on irritability and hyperactivity. New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5-8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722 mg/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU/day vitamin D + 722 mg/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity. Biomarkers (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and omega-3 index) and primary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-months. Out of 111 children who completed baseline data collection, 66% completed the study (VID = 19, OM = 23, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). After 12 months, children receiving OM (-5.0 +/- 5.0, P = 0.001) and VID (-4.0+/-4.9, P = 0.01) had greater reduction in irritability than placebo (0.8+/-6.1). Compared to placebo, children on VID also had greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.2+/-6.3 vs. -0.8+/-5.6, P = 0.047). Serum 25(OH)D concentration (nmol/L, mean+/-SD) increased by 27+/-14 in VID and by 36+/-17 in VIDOM groups (P &lt; 0.0001), and omega-3 index (%, median (25th, 75th percentiles)) by 4.4 (3.3, 5.9) in OM and by 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) in VIDOM groups (P &lt; 0.0001), indicating a good compliance rate. The results indicate that vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA reduced irritability symptoms in children with ASD. Vitamin D also reduced hyperactivity symptoms in these children.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Elsevier Ltd</span><span>A randomised controlled trial of vitamin D and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of irritability and hyperactivity among children with autism spectrum disorder</span></td>

					<td class="tw"><span>The selection of a controlled substance (CS) for use as the positive control article in a nonclinical drug abuse liability (DAL) assessment study should be contemplated carefully and with full understanding of the stated intent of the study design. Any CS that can maintain day-to-day stable baseline responding of voluntary intravenous intakes in animals may be selected under the current guidelines. Schedule I - IV CNS stimulants, depressants, and sedative/hypnotics can serve as maintenance drugs in these protocols, but not all of these compounds will provide comparatively efficient, robust, and stable daily intakes. Each Sponsor is directed to select a positive control article and training dose that will provide the most balanced, predictive, and scientifically-sound comparison consistent with the mechanism of action or therapeutic target of the test article. The SA study design is not a &#034;one-size-fits-all&#034; assay.

					<td class="ab">Objectives A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of methylphenidate (MPH) in children and adolescents by a Cochrane group, led by Storebo, raised concern around the level of evidence supporting the use of this medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. This led to several critical responses from a number of ADHD experts.Methods This paper reviews the conclusions reached from the Storebo meta-analysis by a critical analysis of methodologies used along with drawing on extant literature.Results The controversy raised by the Cochrane meta-analysis should lead to a balanced reflection on the research priorities and needs for the field.Conclusions It is hoped the controversy will ultimately lead to improve the quality of the research on the efficacy, effectiveness and tolerability of MPH for ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; College of Psychiatrists of Ireland 2018.</td>

This led to several critical responses from a number of ADHD experts.Methods This paper reviews the conclusions reached from the Storebo meta-analysis by a critical analysis of methodologies used along with drawing on extant literature.Results The controversy raised by the Cochrane meta-analysis should lead to a balanced reflection on the research priorities and needs for the field.Conclusions It is hoped the controversy will ultimately lead to improve the quality of the research on the efficacy, effectiveness and tolerability of MPH for ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;Copyright &amp;#xa9; College of Psychiatrists of Ireland 2018.</span><span>Cortese S.; samuele.cortese@gmail.com</span><span>622011469</span><span>Cortese S.</span><span>IPMEE</span><span>910490287</span><span>United Kingdom</span><span>Copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.</span><span>*methylphenidate / *adverse drug reaction / *drug therapy</span><span>Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology [17]</span><span>Psychiatry [32]</span><span>Drug Literature Index [37]</span><span>Adverse Reactions Titles [38]</span><span>201924</span><span>(Cortese) Academic Unit of Psychology, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom</span><span>(Cortese) Solent NHS Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom</span><span>(Cortese) Clinical and Experimental Sciences (CNS and Psychiatry), Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom</span><span>(Cortese) Child Study Center, New York University, Langone Medical Center, New York, United States</span><span>3</span><span>0790-9667</span><span>Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine</span><span>ADHD</span><span>amphetamines</span><span>antomoxetine</span><span>methylphenidate</span><span>stimulants</span><span>English</span><span>adolescent</span><span>*attention deficit disorder / *drug therapy</span><span>child</span><span>child behavior</span><span>Child Behavior Checklist</span><span>child health care</span><span>decreased appetite / side effect</span><span>drug efficacy</span><span>drug indication</span><span>drug safety</span><span>drug tolerability</span><span>evidence based medicine</span><span>human</span><span>meta analysis</span><span>outcome assessment</span><span>psychometry</span><span>quality of life</span><span>Review</span><span>risk benefit analysis</span><span>sleep disorder / side effect</span><span>systematic review</span><span>Cambridge University Press (E-mail: Journals_subscriptions@cup.cam.ac.uk)</span><span>&amp;#xa9; College of Psychiatrists of Ireland 2018.</span><span>163-167</span><span>30124188 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30124188]</span><span>Review</span><span>113-45-1 (methylphenidate)</span><span>298-59-9 (methylphenidate)</span><span>adolescent</span><span>*attention deficit disorder/dt [Drug Therapy]</span><span>child</span><span>child behavior</span><span>Child Behavior Checklist</span><span>child health care</span><span>decreased appetite/si [Side Effect]</span><span>drug efficacy</span><span>drug indication</span><span>drug safety</span><span>drug tolerability</span><span>evidence based medicine</span><span>human</span><span>meta analysis</span><span>outcome assessment</span><span>psychometry</span><span>quality of life</span><span>review</span><span>risk benefit analysis</span><span>sleep disorder/si [Side Effect]</span><span>systematic review</span><span>*methylphenidate/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]</span><span>*methylphenidate/dt [Drug Therapy]</span><span>Enhancement type=&#034;8&#034; status=&#034;002&#034;</span><span>Embase</span><span>Journal</span><span>Are the effects of methylphenidate uncertain?</span><span>Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine</span><span>(http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayBackIssues?jid=IPM) Content List URL</span><span>35</span><span>attention deficit disorder / drug therapy / methylphenidate</span><span>decreased appetite / side effect / methylphenidate</span><span>sleep disorder / side effect / methylphenidate</span><span>methylphenidate / adverse drug reaction / decreased appetite</span><span>methylphenidate / adverse drug reaction / sleep disorder</span><span>methylphenidate / drug therapy / attention deficit disorder</span><span>2018</span></td>

					<td class="ab"><span>Background: Perceptual decision making is the process through which available sensory information is gathered and processed to guide our choices. However, the neuropsychopharmacological basis of this important cognitive function is largely elusive. Yet, theoretical considerations suggest that the dopaminergic system may play an important role.</span><span>Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study design, we examined the effect of methylphenidate in 2 dosages (0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg body weight) in separate groups of healthy young adults. We used a moving dots task in which the coherency of the direction of moving dots stimuli was manipulated in 3 levels (5%, 15%, and 35%). Drift diffusion modelling was applied to behavioral data to capture subprocesses of perceptual decision making.</span><span>Results: The findings show that only the drift rate (v), reflecting the efficiency of sensory evidence accumulation, but not the decision criterion threshold (a) or the duration of nondecisional processes (Ter), is affected by methylphenidate vs placebo administration. Compared with placebo, administering 0.25 mg/kg methylphenidate increased v, but only in the 35% coherence condition. Administering 0.5 mg/kg methylphenidate did not induce modulations.</span><span>Conclusions: The data suggest that dopamine selectively modulates the efficacy of evidence accumulation during perceptual decision making. This modulation depends on 2 factors: (1) the degree to which the dopaminergic system is modulated using methylphenidate (i.e., methylphenidate dosage) and (2) the signal-to-noise ratio of the visual information. Dopamine affects sensory evidence accumulation only when dopamine concentration is not shifted beyond an optimal level and the incoming information is less noisy.</span></td>

					<td class="tw"><span>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To investigate functional improvement late (&gt;6 months) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). To this end, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental medicine study to test the hypothesis that a widely used cognitive enhancer would benefit patients with TBI.</span><span>RESEARCH DESIGN: We focused on motor control function using a sequential finger opposition fMRI paradigm in both patients and age-matched controls.</span><span>METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Patients&#039; fMRI and DTI scans were obtained after randomised administration of methylphenidate or placebo. Controls were scanned without intervention. To assess differences in motor speed, we compared reaction times from the baseline condition of a sustained attention task.</span><span>MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Patients&#039; reaction times correlated with wide-spread motor-related white matter abnormalities. Administration of methylphenidate resulted in faster reaction times in patients, which were not significantly different from those achieved by controls. This was also reflected in the fMRI findings in that patients on methylphenidate activated the left inferior frontal gyrus significantly more than when on placebo. Furthermore, stronger functional connections between pre-/post-central cortices and cerebellum were noted for patients on methylphenidate.</span><span>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that residual functionality in patients with TBI may be enhanced by a single dose of methylphenidate.</span><span>Methylphenidate-mediated motor control network enhancement in patients with traumatic brain injury.</span></td>

					<td class="tw"><span>BACKGROUND: to investigate the sleep problems in children with different ADHD presentations and effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on the sleep problems of children with ADHD by both subjective and objective measurements.</span><span>METHODS: 71 children with ADHD and 30 controls were included. 35 had ADHD with predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I) and 36 with predominantly hyperactive/impulsive or combined presentation (ADHD-C). We used the pediatric sleep questionnaire (PSQ) and a nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) to assess the sleep problems in children with ADHD before and 6 months after being treated with methylphenidate (0.3-0.7 mg/kg/dose).</span><span>RESULTS: PSG showed significantly higher apnea-hypopnea index and hypopnea counts, and lower slow-wave sleep percentage in children with ADHD. The results of PSQ reported by parents showed significantly higher rates of delay initiation of sleep, sleep onset latency, sleep fragment, daytime sleepiness, enuresis, bruxism, nightmares, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and snoring in children with ADHD compared to normal controls. Comparisons of ADHD presentations revealed no significant difference between ADHD-I and ADHD-C by either PSG or PSQ measurements. After 6-month MPH treatment, the PSG showed significantly increased total sleep time and reduced periodic limb movement index (PLMI). The PSQ indicated significant reduction in bruxism and snoring in ADHD-I, as well as nightmares in ADHD-C, and both subgroups showed significant reduction in PLMD.</span><span>CONCLUSION: subjective and objective approaches produced inconsistent findings regarding the sleep problems in children with ADHD. Besides, MPH didn&#039;t worsen the sleep problems in children with ADHD.&lt;ovid:br/&gt;&lt;ovid:br/&gt; Copyright &amp;#xa9; 2018 Chang Gung University. Published by Elsevier B.V.

					<td class="ab"><span>BACKGROUND: Previous research has revealed decreased bone mineral density (BMD) among children and adolescents who receive methylphenidate (MP) treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings have major clinical implications given that the prevalence of medication-treated ADHD is on the rise worldwide. We decided to investigate the clinical effect of MP exposure on the incidence of stress fractures, for which a low BMD is a risk factor.</span><span>HYPOTHESIS: Exposure to MP is a risk factor for stress fractures.</span><span>STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.</span><span>METHODS: This is a case-control study of combat soldiers who served in the military for 3 years between 2005 and 2015. The case group included 2400 soldiers with at least 1 stress fracture diagnosed by a bone scan. The control group comprised 6187 combat soldiers without a diagnosis of a stress fracture. The use of MP was determined by an automated text search of medical records and manual sorting of the results. Other study variables included age; sex; weight; height; body mass index (BMI); place of birth; and characterization of fractures by location, side, and grade.
